<h2 id="FOREWORD_TO_THE_READER">FOREWORD TO THE READER.</h2>

<p>The mud-sills of this book are hewn from the presupposition
that the person who reads it has not only the essentially
necessary equipment to do his own thinking, but
also a more or less practiced habit of doing it. It is upon
such foundation the superstructure of this volume was
built. It is written in the hope of promoting, or provoking,
thought on certain subjects, along certain lines&mdash;not to
create or school thinkers. So, if the reader lacks the
necessary cranial furnishing to do his own thinking, or, if
having that, he has a cultivated habit of letting other people
do his hard thinking and an ingrown desire to let them
continue doing so, such reader may as well stop at this
period. In fact, he would better do so. The man who
has his thinking done by proxy is possibly as happy and
comfortable on a siding as he would be anywhere&mdash;as he
is capable of being. I have no desire to disturb his state
or condition of static felicity. Besides, such a man might
“run wild” or otherwise interfere with the traffic if
switched onto the main line.</p>

<p>Emerson has somewheres said, “Beware when God
turns a thinker loose in the world.” Of course Emerson
cautioned about constructive and fighting thinkers, not
thinkers who think they know because somebody told them
so, or who think they have thought till they know all about
some unknowable thing&mdash;the ratio of the diameter to the
circumference of the circle, how to construct two hills
without a valley between, to build a bunghole bigger than
the barrel, and the like.</p>

<p>There are thinkers and thinkers. Emerson had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
distinction between them clearly in mind no doubt when
he wrote that quoted warning. So, also, has the thinking
reader. It is for him this volume is planned; to him its
arguments and statements of fact are intended to appeal.
Its chapters have been hurriedly written&mdash;some of them
written under conditions of physical distress. The
attempts at humor may be attempts only; the irony may be
misplaced or misapplied; the spade-is-a-spade style may
be blunt, harsh or even coarse to the point of offensiveness.
Still, if its reading provokes or otherwise induces thought,
the purpose of its writing, at least in some degree, will have
been attained. It is not asked that the reader agree with
the conclusions of the text. If he read the facts stated and
thinks&mdash;<i>thinks for himself</i>&mdash;he will reach right conclusions.
The facts are of easy comprehension. It requires no
superior academic knowledge nor experience of years to
understand them and their significance&mdash;their lesson.</p>

<p>Just read and think. Do not let any “official”
noise nor breakfast-food rhetoric so syncopate and
segregate your thought as to derail it from the main line
of facts. Lofty, persuasive eloquence is often but the
attractive drapery of planned falsehood, and the beautifully
rounded period is often but a “steer” for an ulterior
motive&mdash;a “tout” for a marked-card game. Do not be
a “come-on” for any verbal psychic work or worker.
Just stubbornly persist in doing your own thinking, ever
remembering that in this vale of tears, “Plain hoss sense’ll
pull you through when ther’s nothin’ else’ll do.”</p>

<p>As a thinker, you will now have lots of company, and
they are still coming in droves. Respectable company,
too. Mr. Roosevelt suddenly <i>arrived</i> a few days since at
Columbus, Ohio. Then there is Mr. Carnegie and Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Gary. The senior Mr. Rockefeller, also, has announced,
through a representative, that he is on the way. These
latter, of course, have been thinkers for many years&mdash;thinkers
on personal service lines chiefly, it has been numerously
asserted. Now, however, if press accounts are
true, they have begun to think, a little at least, about the
general welfare, about the common good&mdash;about the other
fellow.</p>

<p>Whether this change in mental effort and direction, if
change it be, has followed upon a more careful study of
conditions which have so long, so wastefully, or ruthlessly
and viciously governed, or results from the fact that the
advancing years have brought these gentlemen so near
Jericho that they see a gleam of the clearer light and
occasionally hear the “rustle of a wing,” I do not know.
Nor need one know nor care. That they come to join the
rapidly-growing company of thinkers is sufficient.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAL-ADMINISTRATION RUN RIOT.</span></h2>

<p>This is nice winter weather. However, as The Man on the
Ladder was born some distance prior to the week before last, there’s
a tang and chill in the breezes up here about the ladder top which
makes the temperature decidedly less congenial than is the atmosphere
in the editorial rooms of my publisher.</p>

<p>But, say, the view from this elevation is mighty interesting.
The mobilization of the United States soldiery far to the Southwest;
the breaking up of corrals and herds to the West; the starting of
activities about mining camps in the West and Northwest; the
lumber jacks and teams in the spruce forests of the north are indeed
inspiring things to look upon; and over the eastern horizon, there in
the lumber sections of New England and to the Southeast, in the soft
maple, the cottonwood and basswood districts, the people appear to
be industriously and happily active; away to the South&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Say! What’s that excitement over there at Washington, D. C.?</p>

<p>“Hello, Central! Hello! Yes, this is The Man on the Ladder.”</p>

<p>“Get me Washington, D. C., on the L.-D. in a hurry&mdash;and get
Congressman Blank on that end of the wire. The House is in session,
and certainly he ought to be found in not more than five minutes.”</p>

<p>It is something unusually gratifying to see that activity about
that sleepy group of capitol buildings&mdash;the “House of Dollars,”
the house of the <i>hoi polloi</i>, and the White House&mdash;a scene that will
linger in the freshness and fragrance of my remembrance until the
faculty of memory fades away. There are messengers and pages
flitting about from house to house as if the prairies were afire behind
them. Excited Congressmen are in heated discourse on the esplanade,
on the capitol steps and in the corridors and cloak rooms. And
there are numerous groups of Senators, each a kingly specimen of
what might be a <i>real man</i> if there was not so much pickled dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
oozing from his stilted countenance and pose. There now go four of
them to the White House, probably to see the President, our smiling
William. I wonder what they are after. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Hello! Is that you, Congressman Jim?” “Yes?
What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Well, this is The Man on the Ladder, Jim, and I want to know
in the name of heaven&mdash;any other spot you can think of quickly
will do as well&mdash;what’s the occasion and cause for all that external
excitement and activity I see around the capitol building? There
must be a superthermic atmosphere inside both the Senate and
House to drive so many of our statesmen to the open air and jolt
them into a quickstep in their movements. Now go on and tell,
and tell me straight.”</p>

<p>Well, Well! If I did not know my Congressman friend so well,
I would scarcely be persuaded to believe what he has just phoned me.</p>

<p>It appears that a <i>conspiracy</i>&mdash;yes, I mean just that&mdash;a conspiracy
has been entered into between our Chief Executive, a coterie of Senators,
possibly a Congressman or two and a numerous gang of corporate
and vested interests, cappers and beneficiaries, to penalize various
independent weekly and monthly periodicals. Penalize is what I
said. But that word is by no means strong enough. The intent of
the conspirators was&mdash;and <i>is&mdash;to put certain periodicals out of business
and to establish a press censorship in the person of the Postmaster
General as will enable him to put any periodical out of existence which
does not print what it is told to publish</i>.</p>

<p>It would seem that when the Postoffice appropriation bill left
the House, where all revenue measures must originate, it was a fairly
clean bill, carrying some $258,000,000 of the people’s money <i>for
the legitimate service of the people</i>. Of course it carried many service
excesses, just as it has carried in each of the past thirty or forty
years, and several of those <i>looting</i> excesses so conspicuous in every one
of the immediately past fifteen years.</p>

<p>But otherwise, it may be stated, the House approval carried this
bill to the Senate in its usual normal cleanliness. It was referred to
the Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, the members of
which, <i>after conference with the President</i>, annexed to it an alleged
<i>revenue-producing</i> “rider.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>This rider I will later on discuss for the information of my readers.
Here I desire only to call the reader’s attention to the fact that under
the Constitution of the United States the United States Senate has
no more right or authority to originate legislation for producing federal
revenues than has the Hamilton Club of Chicago or the Golf Club at
Possum Run, Kentucky. But the conspirators&mdash;I still use the milder
term, though I feel like telling the truth, which could be expressed
only by some term that would class their action as that of <i>assassinating
education</i> in this country. These conspirators, I say, did not hesitate
to exceed and violate their constitutional obligations and prerogatives.
They added a revenue-producing “rider” to House resolution 31,539.
The rider was to raise certain kinds of second-class matter from a
one-cent per pound rate to a four-cent per pound rate. Not only that,
but they managed to induce Postmaster General Hitchcock to push
into the Senate several <i>ulterior motive</i> reports and letters to boost
the outlawry to successful passage. But, more of this later.</p>

<p>My friend Congressman Jim has just informed me that the
conspirators were beginning to fear their ability even to get their
“rider” to the post for a start; that many members and representatives
of the Periodical Press Association of New York City, as well
as those of other branches of the printing industry, hearing of the
attempt to put this confiscatory rider over in the closing hours&mdash;the
crooked hours&mdash;of Congress, hurried to Washington and sought to
inform Senators and members of the House of the <i>truth about second-class
mail matter</i>. Congressman Jim also informed me that a
delegation representing the publishing interests of Chicago had
arrived a few hours before and were scarcely on the ground before
“things began to happen.” “People talk about Chicagoans making
a noise,” said Jim in his L.-D. message, “but when it comes to doing
things you can count on them to go to it suddenly, squarely and
effectively. That delegation is one of the causes of the excitement
which you notice here. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Friend Jim, being a Chicago boy, may be pardoned even when a
little profuse or over-confident in speaking of what his townsmen can
do, but Congressman Jim is a live-wire Congressman, and has been
able to do several things himself while on his legislative job, even
against stacked-up opposition.</p>

<p>While reporting on Congressman Jim’s message from Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I phoned the leading features to the office and have just received
peremptory orders to write up not only this attempt but other
attempts to raid the postal revenues of the country by means of
crooked riders and otherwise. So there is nothing to do but go to it.</p>

<p>Incidentally, my editor, knowing my tendency to write with a
club, cautions me to adopt the dignified style of composition while
writing upon this subject. I assure my readers that I shall be as
dignified as the heritage of my nature will allow and the subject
warrants. If I occasionally fall from the expected dignified altitude
I trust the reader will be indulgent, will charge the fault, in part at
least, to my remote Alsatian ancestor. He fought with a club. I
have therefore an inherited tendency to write (fight), with a club.
So here goes.</p>

<p>In opening on this important subject, for vastly important it is
from whatever angle one views it, I wish first to speak of the governmental
postoffice department and then of Postmaster Generals.</p>

<p>First I will say that this government has not had, at least within
the range of my mature recollection, any business management of its
postoffice department above the level of that given to Reuben’s
country store of Reubenville, Arkansas.</p>

<p>The second fact I desire to put forward is that since the days of
Benjamin Franklin there have been but few, a possible three or four,
Postmaster Generals who had any qualifications whatsoever, business
or other, to direct the management of so large a business as that
comprehended in the federal postal service. Not only are the chiefs,
the Postmaster Generals, largely or wholly lacking in business and
executive ability to manage so large an industrial and public service,
but their chosen assistants (Second, Third and on up to the Fourth or
Fifth “Assistant Postmaster Generals”), have been and <i>are</i> likewise
lacking in most or <i>all</i> of the essential qualifications fundamentally
necessary to the management and direction of large industrial or
service business enterprises. I venture to say that none of them
have read, and few of them even heard of, the splendid book written
by Mr. Frederick W. Taylor explaining, really giving the A, B, C
of the “Science of Business Management,” which for several years
has been so beneficial in the business and industrial methods in this
country as almost to have worked an economic revolution. I equally
doubt if they have even read the series of articles in one of the monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
periodicals, which Postmaster General Hitchcock and his coterie of
conspirators tried to stab in the back with that Senate “rider” on
the postoffice appropriation bill. Yet Mr. Taylor wrote these articles,
and Mr. Taylor must <i>know</i> a great deal about economic, scientific
business management. <i>He must know</i>, otherwise the Steel Corporation,
the great packing concerns, several railroads, the Yale and Towne
Manufacturing Company, the Link Belt Company and a number of
other large concerns, as well as the trained editors of several engineering
and industrial journals, would not have so generally, likewise profitably,
adopted and approved his recommendations and directions.</p>

<p>Yet while most of these “Assistant Postmaster Generals” and <i>their</i>
subassistants have been glaringly&mdash;yes, discouragingly&mdash;incompetent
to manage and direct the work of their divisions, some of them have
shown an elegance of aptitude, a finished adroitness in using their
official positions to misappropriate, <i>likewise to appropriate to their own
coffers</i>, the funds and revenues of the Postoffice Department. Reference
needs only to be made to the grace and deftness displayed by
August W. Machen, George W. Beavers and their copartners.
The one was Superintendent of Free Delivery, the other Superintendent
of Salaries and Allowances, and the way they, for several years,
made the postoffice funds and revenues “come across” beat any get-rich-quick
concern about forty rods in any mile heat that was reported
in the sporting columns of the daily press.</p>

<p>General Leonard Wood, Congressman Loud and a few other
reputable officials induced President Roosevelt to institute an
investigation. The investigation was made under the direction of
Joseph L. Bristow. Then things were uncovered; that is, some things
were uncovered. In speaking of the nastiness disclosed William Allen
White in 1904 wrote, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>“Most of the Congressmen knew there was something wrong in
Beaver’s department; and Beaver knew of their suspicions; so Congressmen
generally got from him what they <i>went after</i>, and the crookedness
thrived.</p>

<p>“When it was stopped by President Roosevelt, this crookedness
was so far-reaching that when a citizen went to the postoffice to buy
a stamp the cash register which gave him his change was full of graft,
the ink used in canceling the stamp was full of graft, the pad which
furnished the ink was full of graft, the clock which kept the clerk’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
time was full of graft, the carrier’s satchel tie-straps, his shoulder
straps, and his badge were subject to illegal taxation, the money
order blanks were full of graft, the letter boxes on the street were
fraudulently painted, fraudulently fastened to the posts, fraudulently
made, and equipped&mdash;many of them with fraudulent time-indicators.
Often the salaries of the clerks were full of graft. And in the
case of hundreds of thousands of swindling letters and advertisements
that were dropped in the box&mdash;they were full of graft.”</p>

<p>We will now get down to the present Postmaster General, Mr.
Frank H. Hitchcock. I have read, and shall later print in this volume
the Senate “rider” to the postoffice department appropriation bill,
which, so far as The Man on the Ladder has been able to learn, Mr.
Hitchcock either wrote or “steered” in its writing. I have also read
his series of letters to Senator Penrose, Chairman of the Senate
Committee on Postoffices and Postroads; also his 1910 report. At
this point I shall make my comment on Postmaster General Hitchcock
brief but, mayhap, somewhat pointed.</p>

<p>Most Postmaster Generals for the past thirty or more
years have been incompetent. There have been a few notable and
worthy exceptions, but their worthiness was almost completely lost in
the department by reason of previously planted corruption and
political interference. Most Postmaster Generals, as has been stated,
have had little or no qualification for the management and administration
of so large a service industry as that covered by the federal
postoffice department.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock, in his administration of the department, in his
reports and recent letters to the Senate and the House, has shown
himself scarcely up to the <i>average</i> of his incompetent predecessors.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock’s “rider” to the 1911 postoffice appropriation bill
and his recent letters to Senator Penrose and others will convince
any fair-minded, informed reader that he is either an “influenced”
man or is densely ignorant. I wish to make this point emphatic:
The careless, loose, hurried&mdash;yes, even silly&mdash;wording of that “rider”
and the false and foolish statements in his letters to Senator Penrose,
relating to his demand for an increase of three cents a pound on
certain periodicals now carried in the mails as second-class matter at
one cent a pound, he to be given authority to pick out and designate
the periodicals which should be subject to the increased rate&mdash;his false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and foolish statements in that “rider,” and in his recent letters, I say,
must show to any intelligent mind that Mr. Hitchcock is either an
“influenced” man or a six-cylinder, chain-tired, hill-climber of an
ignoramus in matters relating to periodical publication, and also in
many essential matters relating to his department.</p>

<p>My previous statements regarding the government’s postoffice
department, about Postmaster Generals in general and about Mr.
Hitchcock in particular, may not be up to the broadcloth of dignity,
but they do carry the dignity of fact and <i>truth</i>, as I shall proceed to
demonstrate to my readers.</p>

<p>Let us consider first the government postoffice department and
then Mr. Hitchcock’s recent actions and utterances.</p>

<p>Most of the Postmaster Generals, including Mr. Hitchcock,
appear to have been greatly exercised about “deficits,” yet persist in
pursuing methods of business management and direction that must,
almost necessarily, make expenditures of the department exceed its
receipts.</p>

<p>Also I may ask, in this connection, why so much agony, or
“front,” whichever it may be, about a “deficit” in the Postoffice Department?
The postal service of the country is a public service, <i>a
service of all the people. As such the revenues of the federal postoffice
department should not be permitted to exceed the actual cost of the service
rendered under honest, economical and competent management and direction.</i></p>

<p>The departments of war and the navy produce no revenue save
the comparatively speaking trifling sums received from the sale of
junk, abandoned equipment, accoutrements, etc. These departments
render personal or direct service to but a small fraction of the
vast number of people served by the postoffice department. Almost
the entire appropriation for war and the navy in the past forty-five
years might be called a “deficit” so far as any service they have
rendered to the great body of the Nation’s citizenship is concerned.
Yet in the face of all this, so loosely, carelessly and <i>crookedly</i> have the
departments of war and of the navy been managed that there is
scarcely a session of Congress which is not appealed to for huge sums
of money to cover “deficits,” to meet extravagant, wasteful and, not
infrequently, fraudulent expenditures in excess of the vast sums set
aside for them in their annual appropriation bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A few years since it was found that the navy department was
employing more clerks than it employed service men.</i></p>

<p>As to these strictures on the Postoffice Department, I will here
quote for the benefit of readers who may not have studied this postal
service question, a few authorities on the subject under consideration.</p>

<p>A few years ago the methods and abuses of the federal Postoffice
Department were investigated by a joint commission of Congress.
One paragraph of the commission’s report reads as follows and must
be regarded as officially significant:</p>

<p>“It appears too obvious to require argument that the most
efficient service can never be expected as long as the direction of the
business is, as at present, intrusted to a Postmaster General and
certain assistants selected without special reference to experience and
qualifications and subject to frequent change. Under such a system
a large railroad, commercial or industrial business would inevitably
go into bankruptcy and the postoffice department has averted that
fate only because the United States Treasury has been able to meet
deficiencies.”</p>

<p>Pretty plain, straight talk that, is it not?</p>

<p>The resolution to appoint a commission of three members and
appropriate $50,000 for the commission’s use was tacked onto the
postoffice appropriation bill after the Senate “rider” was ditched.
That resolution was under discussion in the House March 3rd (1911)&mdash;the
usual swan-song day for those who failed to “arrive” at the
November election. Mr. Weeks, chairman of the House Committee
on Postoffices and Postroads, led the discussion. The discussion was
participated in by several Congressmen, among whom was Congressman
Moon of Tennessee. Judge Moon is recognized as one of the best
informed men in Congress on postal matters, and particularly
informed as to present methods of transporting and handling second-class
mail. Mr. Moon, though a member of the conference committee
which had just agreed to the bill, Senate resolution and all, as amended
in conference, quite vigorously opposed the appropriation of $50,000
of the people’s money for a “Commission” to investigate the cost of
transporting and handling second-class mail matter. He based his
opposition largely on the fact that two or three previous commissions
had been appointed to investigate the same question or matter; that
these previous commissions had gone into the subject thoroughly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had collected every scrap of information that, under the present
methods, or lack of method, in the postoffice department, it was or is
possible to collect; that these commissions had spent hundreds of
thousands of the people’s money; that they had made complete and
exhaustive reports covering all the information obtained or obtainable;
that these reports are on file and easily accessible, and that
<i>the postal committees of neither Senate nor House had given any attention
or consideration to those reports</i>.</p>

<p>From the many trenchant things said by Mr. Moon I take
the following:</p>

<p>“If the gentleman will excuse me a minute, I am trying to get to
another reason which I want to present to the House as to why I
deem it inappropriate and unwise to pass this legislation. Now, when
the experts undertake to determine just exactly what ought to be
paid for the carrying of the magazines, how the government ought
to be remunerated for the carrying and handling of these magazines,
or other second-class matter, they are bound to take as the basis of
the investigation the manner in which the second-class matter is now
handled and the manner in which it is paid for. In other words, the
basis of weighing and the computation of paying are the basic facts
upon which they must rely in order to determine the question. I
undertake to say to this House deliberately, that in view of our
method of weighing and of the computation of railway mail pay, that
no expert on the face of this earth can today come within fifteen or
twenty millions of dollars of what the compensation ought to be for
the transportation of second-class mail.</p>

<p>“If every fact has been adduced that would lead to a proper
conclusion as to what the pay ought to be, if we are to go again over
the same field of investigation with no possibility of any more light,
tell me what sense there is in expending the public money for that
purpose? And, then the very minute you undertake to reach the
correct result you are confronted with a proposition that you cannot
justly charge the cost of transportation and handling to a class of
matter flatly <i>that in itself produces a return to the government in
another class of matter, probably in excess of the charges of transportation
and handling of that matter itself</i>&mdash;the second class. How are you to
draw the lines for the determination of these questions? You are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the dark; it is a chaotic proposition, considering the method by
which it must be determined today.”</p>

<p>I take it, that however much they may differ from him in his
political and economic views, readers recognize in William Randolph
Hearst one of the most alert and best informed men in this country on
the subject of publishing and distributing periodical literature. He
certainly ranks among the largest, if he is not indeed the largest,
publisher and distributer of newspapers and other periodical prints
there is in this country,&mdash;yes, I may say, in the world.</p>

<p>On February 24, 1911, a letter over Mr. Hearst’s signature
appeared in the Washington Post. In this communication he
touches upon the efficiency&mdash;rather the inefficiency&mdash;of the Postoffice
Department in handling the postal service of this country. I would
like to reproduce the letter entire, but cannot. I will, however,
reprint some of its cogent statements which bear largely upon the
point under consideration. Mr. Hearst says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I know something about the cost of distribution of publications. I know
something about the reasons for the excessive cost of distribution of the postoffice.
And I say that the high cost of distribution in the postoffice is largely due to loose
and careless and reckless methods, to antiquated systems and incompetent
management.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 40 per cent of the charged weight of mail matter is
composed of cumbersome mail bags and their heavy iron locks and fastenings.</p>

<p>How absurd to imagine that a man who wanted to break into a mail bag
would be deterred by a ponderous lock.</p>

<p>The postoffice department might as well insist that a burglar-proof lock be
affixed to every letter, under the inane impression that the only way to tear
open a letter would be to pick a lock.</p>

<p>I know, too, personally and positively, of an instance where the great mass
of western mail was sent over one railroad and when the bulk of it was transferred
to another railroad, all the postal clerks previously employed were maintained
on the first railroad for over two years after the mail had been transferred.</p>

<p>The Evening Journal, without any of the powers of the great United States
government behind it, distributes its product for seven-tenths of a cent a pound,
and included in this average is the 1-cent-a-pound rate paid to the government
for copies mailed. Obviously, then, the proportion of the product which is not
carried by the postoffice is delivered for much less than seven-tenths of a cent
per pound.</p>

<p>The New York American distributes by mail and express 303,584 pounds
of daily and Sunday papers every week at a cost of $1,655.17, or little over one-half
a cent per pound. This average includes 28,028 pounds sent by mail at 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
cent per pound, so, obviously, the average of matter not distributed by mail is
less than one-half a cent per pound.</p>

<p>The New York American sends 67,268 pounds of these papers over the
Pennsylvania Railroad at one-fourth of a cent per pound, or one-fourth the rate
paid to the United States postoffice department.</p>

<p>That same rate&mdash;one-fourth of a cent per pound&mdash;is exactly the rate charged
by the Canadian Government for carrying magazines by mail through its postoffice
department and for distributing them over a thinly populated territory
even greater than the United States.</p>

<p>How absurd, then, to assert that the government cannot distribute the
magazines profitably at this present rate when it handles the magazines along
with all other mail distributed and without any particular extra expense because
of them.</p>

<p>Even if, as I said, the government were handling the magazines at a loss,
it would be doing a creditable thing. But it is not handling the magazines at a
loss. It is carrying them at a profit, and if it taxes the magazines out of existence
it will compel the postal department to be conducted at a greater loss than the
loss at which it is now conducted.</p>

<p>What inconsistency, too, for the administration to advocate a government
subsidy to restore a United States merchant marine and at the same time advocate
a measure to put out of existence a much more important American institution.</p>

<p>If it is a Republican policy to promote business and encourage industry,
and a proper Republican and American policy to take money out of the United
States Treasury to subsidize a private business in order to create an industry,
why is it not a proper Republican and American policy to continue to provide
a cheap mail rate in order to maintain a great American industry and perpetuate
a mighty educational influence already existent?</p>

</div>

<p>The evidence in support of my impeachment of the Postoffice
Department on account of its almost total lack of business method,
its absolute helplessness to tell, even with approximate accuracy,
the loss of any division of its service, or the revenues resulting from
any given source or class of mail carried, would not be complete
without quoting Senator Penrose and former Senator Carter.</p>

<p>Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania is Chairman of the Senate
Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, and former Senator Carter
was conceded to be one of the well informed men on postal
matters in Congress.</p>

<p>The excerpt from Senator Penrose is from an address he made on
the floor of the Senate, within the year, when speaking to the subject
of second-class mail rates, and that from Mr. Carter is from his address
on the same subject made in March, 1910. Both follow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>It is idle to take up such questions as apportioning the cost for carrying
second-class mail matter or the proper compensation of railroads for transporting
the mails until we shall have established business methods in postoffice affairs by
a reorganization of the whole postal system.&mdash;<i>Senator Penrose.</i></p>

<p>I deeply sympathize with the earnest desire of the department officials to
get rid of the deficiency they are fated to encounter every year, but I submit that
the first real movement toward that end must begin with the substitution of a
modern, up-to-date business organization for the existing antiquated system.&mdash;<i>Senator
Carter.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Comment on the plain, blunt statements of these members of our
highest legislative body, each admittedly well informed on the subject
to which he speaks, is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>In closing this division of my subject I desire to quote President
Taft; quote from his message to Congress under date of March 3,
1911. It is an illuminating message and forcefully pertinent to the
point we are considering. I would like to reprint the entire document,
but fear I cannot do so. Of course, President Taft’s strictures and
adverse criticisms are general&mdash;since they apply to all governmental
departments&mdash;but every official in Washington knows, and none
better than the President himself, that they have both adhesive and
cohesive qualities when applied to the postoffice department.</p>

<p>In this message the President asks for an appropriation of
$75,000 to continue the work he has already begun, that of revising
departmental methods of doing business and of instituting a practical,
commonsense system of accounting under which, or from which, it
will be possible for administrative and legislative officials to learn,
approximately at least, just what departments have done&mdash;to any
date&mdash;and just what it has cost to do it, two items of information as
appears from the message of the Chief Executive which neither his
nor any previous administration has ever been able to learn, and
is not <i>now</i> able to learn with any considerable degree of dependable
accuracy.</p>

<p>As yet I have not learned whether the President obtained the
$75,000 asked for. I hope he did. If Congress will appropriate
$750,000 for the purpose the President names in his message, and sees
to it that the money is judiciously and intelligently disbursed, it is
the opinion of The Man on the Ladder that <i>not less than $100,000,000
annually would be saved in government expenditures</i>, or one hundred
millions more of service, material, equipment, etc., delivered for the
money now expended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Following is the essential part of the President’s message. The
italics are the writer’s:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:</p>

<p>I ask that you include in the sundry civil bill an appropriation for $75,000
and a <i>reappropriation</i> of the unexpended balance of the existing appropriation to
enable me to continue my investigation <i>by members of the departments</i> and by
experts of the business methods now employed by the government, with a view to
securing greater economy and efficiency in the dispatch of government business.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in securing economy and reform <i>is the lack of accurate
information as to what the money of the government is now spent for</i>. Take the
combined statement of the receipts and disbursements of the government for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910&mdash;a report required by law, and the <i>only one</i>
purporting to give an analytical separation of the expenditures of the government.
This shows that the expenditures for salaries for the year 1910 were $132,000,000
out of $950,000,000. As a matter of fact, the expenditures for personal services
during that year <i>were more nearly $400,000,000</i>, as we have just learned by the
inquiry now in progress under the authority given me by the last congress.</p>

<p>The only balance sheet provided to the administrator or to the legislator as a
basis for judgment is one which leaves out of consideration <i>all assets other than
cash, and all liabilities other than warrants outstanding, a part of the trust liabilities
and the public debt</i>. In the liabilities no mention is made of about $70,000,000
special and trust funds so held. No mention is made of outstanding contracts
and orders issued as incumbrances on appropriations; of invoices which have not
been vouchered; of vouchers which have not been audited. It is, therefore,
<i>impossible for the administrator to have in mind the maturing obligations to meet
which cash must be provided; there is no means for determining the relation of
current surplus or deficit</i>. No operation account is kept, and no statement of
operations is rendered showing the expenses incurred&mdash;<i>the actual cost of doing
business</i>&mdash;on the one side, and the revenues accrued on the other. There are no
records showing the cost of land, structures, equipment, or the balance of stores
on hand available for future use; there is no information coming regularly to the
administrative head of the government or his advisers advising them as to
<i>whether sinking-fund requirements have been met, or of the condition of trust funds
or special funds</i>.</p>

<p>It has been urged that such information as is above indicated could not be
obtained, for the reason that the accounts were on a cash basis; that they <i>provide
for reports of receipts and disbursements only</i>. But even the accounts and reports
of receipts and disbursements are on a basis which makes a true statement of
facts <i>impossible</i>. For example: All of the trust receipts and disbursements of
the government, other than those relating to currency trusts, are reported as
“<i>ordinary receipts and disbursements</i>.” The daily, as well as the monthly and
annual statements of disbursements, are mainly made up from advances to disbursing
officers&mdash;<i>that is to say, when cash is transferred from one officer to another
it is considered as spent</i>, and the disbursement accounts and reports of the government
so show them. The only other accounts of expenditures on the books of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the Treasury are based on audited settlements most of which <i>are months in arrears of
actual transactions</i>; as between the record of cash advanced to disbursing officers and
the accounts showing audited vouchers, there is a current difference of from
<i>$400,000,000 to $700,000,000, representing vouchers which have not been audited
and settled</i>.</p>

<p>Without going into greater detail, the conditions under which legislators
and administrators, <i>both past and present</i>, have been working may be summarized
as follows: <i>There have been no adequate means provided whereby either the President
or his advisers may act with intelligence on current business before them; there has
been no means for getting prompt, accurate and correct information as to results
obtained; estimates of departmental needs have not been the subject of thorough analysis
and review before submission; budgets of receipts and disbursements have been
prepared and presented for the consideration of Congress in an unscientific and unsystematic
manner; appropriation bills have been without uniformity or common
principle governing them; there have been practically no accounts showing what the
government owns, and only a partial representation of what it owes; appropriations
have been overencumbered without the facts being known; officers of government have
had no regular or systematic method of having brought to their attention the costs of
governmental administration, operation and maintenance, and therefore could not
judge as to the economy or waste; there has been inadequate means whereby those who
served with fidelity and efficiency might make a record of accomplishment and be
distinguished from those who were inefficient and wasteful; functions and establishments
have been duplicated, even multiplied, causing conflict and unnecessary
expense; lack of full information has made intelligent direction impossible and co-operation
between different branches of the service difficult.</i></p>

<p>I am bringing to your attention this statement of the present lack of facility
for obtaining prompt, complete, and accurate information in order that congress
may be advised of the conditions which the President’s inquiry into economy
and efficiency has found and which the administration is seeking to remedy.
Investigations of administrative departments by congress have been many, each
with the same result. <i>All the conditions above set forth have been repeatedly
pointed out.</i> Some benefits have accrued by centering public attention on defects
in organization, method, and procedure, but generally speaking, however salutary
the influence of legislative inquiries (and they should at all times be welcome), the
installation and execution of methods and procedure, which <i>will place a premium
on economy and efficiency and a discount on inefficiency and waste</i> must be carefully
worked out and introduced by those responsible for the details of administration.</p>

</div>

<p>Does that broad accusation of the President approve or disapprove
our previously expressed opinion of governmental department
service in general and of the postoffice department in particular?
Notice the statements I have taken the liberty to <i>italicize</i>. Permit
me to repeat a few of them:</p>

<p>“The chief difficulty in securing economy and reform <i>is the lack of
accurate information as to what the money of the government is spent for</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Does not that fully bear out what Judge Moon said in discussing
the Senate resolution to appropriate $50,000 more for a second-class
mail commission&mdash;devote fifty thousand more after the government
had already spent several hundred thousands delving into the same
subject and got little or nothing of value, by reason of the loose,
careless and <i>wasteful</i> methods of the federal postal department?</p>

<p>… “<i>There is no means for determining the
relation of current surplus or deficit.</i>”</p>

<p>An <i>inviting</i> business situation that, is it not? Especially
“inviting” is it to officials and subordinates who want something
they have not earned, who want to <i>find</i> something.</p>

<p>“No operation account is kept, and no statement of operations
is rendered showing the expenses incurred&mdash;<i>the actual cost of doing
business</i>&mdash;the actual cost of doing business on the one side and the
revenues accrued on the other.”</p>

<p>Now, my dear reader, don’t you know that such a method or
system, or lack of method or system, would put a western corn farm
in “financial distress” the first season and out of business the second?
A cattle ranch, handled on such loose, <i>ignorant</i> methods would be
sold out in a year. What, in reduction, does this <i>unqualified</i> statement
of our President mean?</p>

<p>It means that the heads of governmental departments <i>do not
know</i>; that their subordinates <i>do not know</i>, and, therefore, our President,
our Senators and our Congressmen <i>do not know</i>. Nor can they,
under existing conditions and methods, <i>find out</i>. They cannot find
out even the common&mdash;the basic&mdash;essentials of business methods and
management which Job Fraser, down in “Egypt,” must know in
order to keep his hen range out of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Do you remember a quotation, some pages back, from the joint
commission which investigated the postoffice department? The
investigation which <i>rummaged</i> into the second-class mail schedule
particularly? If you do not remember, turn back and read it again.
It fits like the skin of an Alberta peach to what the President has just
said (March 3, 1911), in his message from which we have quoted.</p>

<p>While collecting millions of revenue beyond all possible expenditures,
under competent, honest management, our federal postoffice
department would have gone into bankruptcy save for the backing
of the government’s treasury&mdash;<i>for the backing of your money</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“The only other accounts of expenditures on the books of the
treasury are based on audited settlements, most of which are <i>months
in arrears of actual transactions</i>; as between the record of cash advanced
to disbursing officers and the accounts showing audited
vouchers, there is a <i>current difference of from $400,000,000 to $700,000,000,
representing vouchers which have not been audited and settled</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course, I do not know how that may strike the reader. It
strikes the writer, however, as being about as near the limit as any
individual or corporation could go without falling over the financial
edge and nearer the limit <i>than any sensible, well and honestly directed
government should go</i>.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;No, I will requote no more. Turn back and read the
quotation from the President’s message again. Read carefully,
and then read it once more. Any citizen, whose mental tires are not
punctured will be not only a wiser but a bigger and better citizen
for having done so.</p>

<p>It was my intention to close this division of my subject with the
excerpts from President Taft’s message. My attention however was
called to a move made by Postmaster General Hitchcock, and an
interview had with him bearing on said move. It was taken note of
and “spaced” by a majority of the newspapers having general circulation
in the United States. What I shall here quote is taken from
a Chicago paper of date April 1, and the “write-up,” nearly a column,
is based, it is probable, on a wire to the journal either from its Washington
correspondent or a news agency. As the article appeared in
so many newspapers I take it that the information conveyed is entirely
dependable.</p>

<p>From the write-up it appears that Postmaster General Hitchcock
has made “a round dozen” of changes among the postal officials
in the railway mail service. Some of the changes were promotions&mdash;on
the government’s pay roll&mdash;changes of division superintendents
from one division to another, shifting of division chief clerks and
of division inspectors, etc., etc. Theodore Ingalls, formerly superintendent
of “rural mails,” is now superintendent of the “railway
mail service,” succeeding Alexander Grant, who, the friendly space
writer says, “is one of the most widely known postoffice officials in the
service.” Whether favorably or unfavorably known, the write-up
sayeth not. At any rate, Mr. Grant goes to the St. Paul division of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the railway mail service at $1,000 per year less than he formerly
drew from the postoffice department funds. Per contra, Mr. Ingalls
steps from “rurals” to railway mails at an increase of $1,000. The
other “round dozen” changes are of similar character, though
affecting positions subordinate or minor to the ones named.
No dismissals, just shifting the official pegs around, possibly for the
“good of the service,” as Mr. Hitchcock says; possibly for other
reasons. It is to be hoped that Postmaster General Hitchcock
stated the entire truth and that these changes are for the good of the
service. The railway mail service is certainly in dire need of betterment,
as the reader will learn before I finish, if he but has the interest
and the patience to follow me to the end.</p>

<p>Why Mr. Hitchcock did not make some <i>twelve hundred</i> changes in
the railway mail service instead of a “round dozen,”&mdash;and many of
them dismissals&mdash;I do not know. Perhaps Mr. Hitchcock does
know. Let us hope he does and be thankful for small favors. Many
people, however, who have watched the Postoffice Department’s
maneuverings during the past forty years have seen too many “Sunday
Editions” put to mail to be fooled by any of this “shake-up” talk.
This shifting of the official shoats from one pen to another, still leaving
them with their noses and four feet in the trough, is a too common and
well known practice in the police and other public safety departments
of our larger cities to fool anybody who has had his eyes open since
the first full moon in April, 1868.</p>

<p>Shake-ups which do not retire incompetent or “faulted” public
officials and servants, just as a “faulted” casting is rejected at
“milling,” is not a “shake-up” that will stand good in any strata of
human intelligence above that found in asylums for broken-down
cerebral equipment. It is <i>betterments</i>, not “shake-ups,” that are
needed.</p>

<p>The reader will please understand that there is no personal
animus in what I here&mdash;or elsewhere&mdash;write. I have not had the
pleasure, and possibly the honor, of personal acquaintance with Mr.
Ingalls, Mr. Grant and others of the “round dozen” involved in the
Postmaster General’s “shake-up.” They are probably all fine
gentlemen personally, whom it would be a privilege to meet and to
know. But we are writing to a subject <i>infinitely larger than any man
or set of men</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of this country are “up against” a <i>postal service
proposition</i>&mdash;a proposition so stupendous in import, so far-reaching
in its application, so crucial in its effects upon us and the
children who follow us, and involving service so incompetent, so
wasteful, so <i>corrupt</i> in its management and operation as to have appalled
those of us who have watched and studied its practices, and to
have become a joke, provoking a smile or laugh among postal
officials of other nations who render a service that <i>serves</i>.</p>

<p>For upward of forty years&mdash;a few bright spots excepted&mdash;our
Postoffice Department has shown itself not only incompetent in the
matter of business management, but disregardful in serving the people
who <i>pay for the service</i>. I am aware this is a bald statement, a “mere
assertion,” some postoffice official or sinecure postal “servant” may
say, but it will have to be said more often, more carefully and studiedly
and far more <i>eloquently</i>, in order to have it believed outside the
family circle than it ever has heretofore been said to get the people
of this country to stand for it.</p>

<p>In the “write-up” annexed to Postmaster General Hitchcock’s
few paragraphs of interview, the “space” artist gives us, in epitome,
the biography of the men Mr. Hitchcock promotes and demotes in
that “round dozen” of changes. Some of my readers may have
scanned the “booster” newspaper stuff of which I am writing. If so,
much of what I have here said may be bricks or straw, just as it may
happen that they know or do not know the true “innards” of the
service status of this Postoffice Department of ours. I will not do
more here than to point to the epitome biographical sketches
of the promotes and demotes in the friendly “write-up.”</p>

<p>In substance it says that Mr. Ingalls “is a highly trained postal
official” and “entirely familiar with the railway mail system, having
begun his postal work in that service.”</p>

<p>Now, we all sincerely hope that is true. I once ran a sawmill,
but, candidly, I do not believe that any sensible business man would
hire me today to run his saws in any mill turning out mixed cuts. It
may be that Mr. Ingalls has accumulated just the proper, and the
proper amount of, information in superintending “rurals” to
enable&mdash;to qualify&mdash;him to manage and direct that case-hardened,
<i>looting</i> division known as the Railway Mail Service. Let us hope
that he knows how to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In the past twenty-five or thirty years it has been conclusively
shown that the postoffice department, <i>en tout</i>, knows about as much
concerning the <i>railroad</i> end of the railway mail service as a mongrel
spitz poodle knows of astronomy.</p>

<p>So I might comment on other names mentioned in the write-up
of this “shake-up” of our Postmaster General. They have all
<i>been</i> good men. Possibly they each and all are good men <i>yet</i>&mdash;for the
jobs to which the Postmaster General has promoted or demoted them.
The people may appreciate and even honor Jim Jones because he
“worked his way up” from mail carrier on a rural route at Rabbit
Hash, Mississippi, to Superintendent of the Cincinnati Division or the
St. Paul Division of the railway mail service, and even more so, if he
got stilted to the position of “Superintendent of the Railway Mail
Service.” Still, listen. While we, the people, at Rabbit Hash, Mississippi,
may be entirely satisfied to see our boy, Jim Jones, move up the
ladder to official honor and salary, how about you other 93,760,000
people? You want prompt, cheap service in the railway
mail and our Jim Jones fails to give it to you,&mdash;<i>fails when you know
the conditions and the facilities are at call and command to give it
to you</i>.</p>

<p>What is the answer? Simply that you 93,760,000 other folks may
not think so well of our Jim Jones’ railway mail service ability&mdash;or
business ability&mdash;as we of Rabbit Hash may think.</p>

<p>Now I have said enough about Postmaster General Hitchcock’s
“shake-up.” What I have not said the intelligent reader will readily
infer&mdash;<i>and there is a whole lot to be inferred</i>.</p>

<p>At the outset I intended to quote Mr. Hitchcock&mdash;quote Mr.
Hitchcock himself&mdash;in evidence or proof of my previously made and
repeated statement, that the Postoffice Department is incompetently,
is <i>wastefully</i>, if not crookedly, managed and directed.</p>

<p>I am now going to quote Mr. Hitchcock. Of course, he here
speaks of only the railway mail service. It is admittedly
one of the worst divisions for <i>waste and steal</i>. But there are others
scarcely a neck behind.</p>

<p>The subjoined dispatch states (March 31, 1911), that “while
signing the orders necessary for the changes Mr. Hitchcock said:”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>The investigation which we conducted so long and so carefully indicated
clearly that the action which I have taken was absolutely necessary. <i>The railway
mail service has suffered greatly from poor management and lack of supervision.</i></p>

<p>In certain of the divisions it was found that the chief clerks had not been
inspecting their lines, as was their duty. <i>Some of the routes had received no
inspection for several years.</i> …</p>

<p>The inquiry showed that the business methods of the service in several
offices <i>were antiquated and that, as a consequence, there was much duplication of
work</i>. Instructions from the department directing improvements, as for example
the proper consolidation of mail matter and the conservation of equipment,
received <i>only perfunctory attention</i>.</p>

<p>There had been a lack of co-operation also in carrying into effect certain
reforms which I had indicated, and it was made evident by the inquiry that <i>no
proper spirit of co-ordination with the department existed in the railway mail service</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL RIDER.</span></h2>

<p>We will now give our consideration to Postmaster General
Hitchcock and the “rider.” I may say some plain, blunt things of
him. If so, it is because I believe Mr. Hitchcock’s official action and
statements touching the recent legislative move were a deliberate,
calculated attempt to ruin some of the greatest periodicals the world
has ever known, yes, <i>the</i> greatest periodicals the world has ever known.
Not only was it that, but the method and time of presentation in the
session, as well as the questionable secretiveness of that official in
preparing and advancing the measure, supply reasonably valid grounds
for the charge frequently made that this attempt at “snap” legislation
was but a step in a conspiracy to throttle the periodical press,
to place a muzzle on the most effective means of education which our
people have had during the past two decades.</p>

<p>Nationally we have far departed from the mudsill principles of
the democratic polity which our founders in their best judgment had
framed for us and bespattered the forest paths of the country with
their blood to <i>maintain</i> for us&mdash;the forest paths not alone of the
Atlantic states but also of those vast acquisitions in the West, known
in history as the Northwest Territory and the Louisiana purchases, out
of which the fathers carved so many imperial states. So far indeed
have we departed from those principles, regained from tyranny and
maintained for us by the founders and builders of this governmental
polity, that their original <i>intent</i> has been lost sight of by many of our
people.</p>

<p>As a result of the struggle for subsistence on the one hand and
<i>corrupt political practice</i> on the other, we are traveling rapidly toward
the old, old way. As the kilted Scots put it, quoting Bulwer Lytton,
we are rapidly reaching that view of life which leads men, in the heat
of a justified anger, to say “Happy is the man whose father went to
the devil;” meaning thereby that our sons <i>can be happy</i> if we manage
to steal and loot enough from the government, or from our fellow
citizens through <i>governmental favor and protection</i>, to build for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sons stone fronts on “Easy street” and leave a bank balance and
“vested interests” sufficient to maintain them.</p>

<p>People happy in the enjoyment of unearned wealth seldom
make good, safe or dependable judges or lawmakers for people who
are unhappy.</p>

<p>There may be, of course, some rare exceptions to that statement.
The history of twenty centuries, however&mdash;yes, of forty centuries&mdash;has
shown very few of them. This may appear to some as a digression
from my subject. Well, so count it, if you will. I have made it
as a “foreword” for three statements I wish to make&mdash;statements
cogently asserted in support of an assertion made some paragraphs
back.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock, in both action and advocacy, has not only been a
conspicuous member, as newspapers and other reports show, but a
leading factor, in the gang of “influenced” mercenaries and aspiring
politicians who sought to “submerge” certain periodicals which for
ten or more years <i>have been telling the people the truth&mdash;the truth
about crooked corporation practices and about crooked public officials</i>.</p>

<p>I am here going to make those three statements. I believe them
statements of <i>fact</i>. Think them over. <i>Study</i> them. If, after, you
think I am wrong or overstate the facts, then&mdash;well, then, that is your
affair, not mine. Remember, I write with a <i>club</i>&mdash;not a pencil.</p>

<p>The first of the three statements I wish here to make is: The
social and political polity which patriotic and liberty-loving progenitors
gave us, established for us, has been adroitly led from its prescribed
way. Today our governmental and social organizations are
<i>rich in policemen, soldiers, prisons, poorhouses, organized charities,
charity balls, owners of unearned wealth and in politicians who helped
those owners to acquire that unearned wealth and who furthermore
continue to protect them in its possession</i>.</p>

<p>The second statement I wish my readers to consider is: The
periodical monthlies and weeklies (and a few “yellow” newspapers),
which Mr. Hitchcock and his coterie of conspirators would muzzle
or, by laying an excessive mail rate upon them, suppress or ruin&mdash;and
incidentally, make the Postmaster General <i>an unrestrained censor
of the country’s periodical literature</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Those periodicals, I started to say, have given more <i>real</i> educational
benefit to the adult population of this country during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
past ten years <i>than has been given by all the “little red school
houses,” colleges, universities, and churches combined</i>.</p>

<p>I do not, as you will notice, include the “political stump.” I do
not care to comment on its peculiar didactic value or fascination for
fools. That means both you and me, reader. We each, occasionally,
go to hear the political “stumper” tell us a lot of <i>“influenced” lies</i>.</p>

<p>The third statement I wish to make is: Postmaster General
Hitchcock is, so far as the writer has been able to learn, a politician.
Not only is he a politician, the reports read, but he is a wise, smooth
and “<i>ambitious</i>” politician.</p>

<p>That is bad. “Why?” Well, because an “ambitious” politician
is about as useful to us, to you and to me, as are bugs in our potato
patch, or dry rot in our sheep herd. The “ambitious” politician is
a disease, attacking either our kitchen garden or our mutton supply.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>Here is one answer: It is a long way between “three
rooms rear and a palace.” But even they who crawl about the
earth, begging for leave to live, <i>see</i> things, <i>hear</i> things, <i>feel</i> things, and
<i>read</i> things. They are beginning to <i>understand</i> much of what they
<i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>feel</i> and <i>read</i>.</p>

<p>Is that, Mr. Hitchcock, a reason, one of the reasons, why you
who have so energetically, likewise offensively, tried to shut us out
from our main source of information, from our mental commissary?</p>

<p>Arise, please, and answer.</p>

<p>There are still other remarks which I must make about Mr.
Hitchcock’s peculiar <i>recent</i> action and talk. It may not be at all
pleasant to him. Yet the statements I shall make, I am ready to
support by a “cloud of witnesses.”</p>

<p>As before stated, this attempt to muzzle the press of the country,
for that appears to be the ultimate, likewise the <i>ulterior</i>, purpose of
Mr. Hitchcock and his coterie of senatorial and other abettors in
their recent attempt to outrage the <i>constitutional</i> rights of our people,
the <i>constitutional</i> rights of the Lower House and the rules of both
Senate and House, as Senator Robert L. Owen, in brief but
pertinent remarks in the recent closing days of the late session
(February 25, 1911), pointed out,&mdash;remarks rife with the cogency
of truth.</p>

<p>In a previous paragraph I stated, in effect, that Postmaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
General Hitchcock is an “influenced” man or a densely ignorant one.
That he <i>is</i> densely ignorant on matters pertaining to periodical publications
has been amply evidenced by subsequent quotations from
his own reports and letters. That he at least shares the prevailing
ignorance as to the methods, and the <i>result</i> of methods, for handling
the vast business of the federal Postoffice Department, I have
already pointed out.</p>

<p>Possibly I am in error here, but when Senators and Congressmen
who have studied for years the methods of handling business in
the Postoffice Department were&mdash;and are&mdash;convinced that it is impossible
for the most expert accountants to collect and collate <i>dependable</i>
information, relating either to any of its divisions of service or to
the department in general; when old and tried students of the
loose, wasteful methods of this department, of its utter lack of business
system, yes, of its <i>crooks</i> and <i>crookedness</i>&mdash;when, I say, such experienced
students frankly and bluntly state their complete inability
to gather any dependable data as to the business done by Mr.
Hitchcock’s department, I am in doubt as to the correctness, or
lack of correctness, in my previous intimation that Mr. Hitchcock is
ignorant of his departmental affairs and practices, as well as of
matters pertaining to periodical publication and distribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock has been at the head of his department something
like three years, I believe. He has talked so much and written so
much about postal “deficits,” about the cause of those deficits and
how to remedy them by holding up periodical publishers, that, maybe,
he has learned more about his department, more about deficits and
the cause of them&mdash;learned more about these things in <i>three years</i> than
older and more experienced men have learned in ten years&mdash;yes,
twenty.</p>

<p>Maybe he has. If so, then I was in error when I intimated
that his ignorance extended to departmental matters as well as to
periodical publishing. If, however, I was in error as to Mr. Hitchcock’s
knowledge of his departmental matters, I find myself in a
multitudinous and <i>growing</i> company of intelligent and informed
people to whom he will have to talk and write much more, and to talk
and write far more eloquently, persuasively and <i>wisely</i> than he has
thus far talked and written, to convince them that he has accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
more departmental wisdom in three years than numerous older
students of the subject gathered in ten.</p>

<p>What training or opportunity Mr. Hitchcock had, previous to
his installation in his present position, to qualify him for the office&mdash;training
and opportunity which enabled him to grasp so comprehensively,
as he would have it appear, the duties, functions, faults
in accounting, <i>frailties</i> in the service personnel,&mdash;in short, all the
essentials of knowledge and information pertaining to a competent
administration of the department, general, divisional and in detail,
I do not know.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Frank H. Hitchcock was chairman of the Republican
National Committee in 1908, which committee, with the aid of
“a very limited campaign fund,” as one colossally profound “stumper”
put it, steered the votes to Judge Taft and himself to his present
exalted position. Now, this experience of Mr. Hitchcock may or may
not have especially qualified him for ready, quick and comprehensive
understanding of all that the Postoffice Department needs to <i>make it
yield even a half of what the people of this country are today paying
for</i>.</p>

<p>It may have done so. Thoughtful people, however, are numerously
entertaining a private opinion, and thousands of them are
publicly expressing it, to the effect that, so far, Mr. Hitchcock’s
voluminous talk about the affairs, methods, needs and “deficits”
of his department displays a knowledge of the subjects he talks about
far more comprehensive than comprehending. That is, he has talked
assertively or persuasively, as his auditor or audience fit into his
purpose, upon numerous departmental phases of administration,
regarding which final analysis in the crucible of “plain hoss sense”
shows he knows little.</p>

<p>And he knew <i>less</i> when he talked than he now knows. The
periodical publishers of the country have been “handing him” some
information, <i>after they got notice of what he was trying “to put over,”
since he went to President Taft not later than October or mid-November
last</i>. I say that, because President Taft <i>covered Mr. Hitchcock’s
idea</i> (or scheme) <i>of removing the postal department deficit in his
December message for 1910</i>.</p>

<p>Now, did Mr. Hitchcock influence President Taft, or did
President Taft influence Mr. Hitchcock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>That is the question; whether it is better to be the “influenced”
or the “influencer.”</p>

<p>The above query may be awkward, or even an uncouth way to
state the question, but in evidence that it is a question with thoughtful
people&mdash;<i>informed people</i>. I desire here to quote some statements
written by <a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Samuel G. Blythe. With no thought of discriminating
praise I can positively say that Samuel G. Blythe <i>stands with the best
of you boys who are doing so much for our enlightenment</i>&mdash;<span class="smcapuc">FOR OUR
EDUCATION&mdash;IN MATTERS RELATING TO OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT</span>.</p>

<p>Is not that right, boys?</p>

<p>I hear a unanimous “aye.”</p>

<p>In this connection, however, I wish to remind you boys that many
of you&mdash;most of you, probably&mdash;have done as much to help the people
of the country in your <i>local</i> fields of interest and activity as you
have done to enlighten us as to Washington’s politics, policies and
<i>tangential peculiarities</i>.</p>

<p>With this explanation for my taking our “Sam” instead of you
other boys for quotation, maybe <i>mutilation</i>, just here in the context
of this book, I may add that his article in the Saturday Evening Post
of date, April 15, 1911, is before me. It so <i>fits</i> the point I am now
considering&mdash;whether Postmaster General Hitchcock was “influenced”
or “influencing”&mdash;that I am going to quote, and, possibly, take all
sorts of liberties with Mr. Blythe’s splendid presentation of Mr.
Hitchcock’s attitude, action and <i>animus</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe, in his article in the Saturday Evening Post, (published
by the Curtis Publishing Company, Philadelphia, and, by the
way, one of the most educative weekly periodicals the world has ever
known), tells us something of Postmaster General Hitchcock’s
procedure since in office.</p>

<p>I am here going to appropriate some of the information furnished
in Mr. Blythe’s article. Whether I use quotation marks or not, I
want the reader to know that Samuel G. Blythe has “wised me up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
heap” regarding our Postmaster General’s peculiar official gyrations
since the latter arrived on his present job.</p>

<p>First, it would appear that Mr. Hitchcock arrived with the
“deficit” in his brain. I mean, of course, the Postoffice Department
deficit was <i>on</i> his mind, and being fresh from that state of splendid
attainments and beans&mdash;Massachusetts&mdash;Mr. Hitchcock came to his
job brimful of nerve, purpose and postal service deficits. He was
determined to do things, especially to that <i>deficit</i>. Well, he has been
doing things, but scarcely in a way that one would expect from a
man coming from the people who grow up there. The writer cannot
say whether or not Mr. Hitchcock “growed up there.” If he
did, some cog must have slipped or “jammed” in his raising. Most
born Plymouth rock men whom I have met, and I have had the
pleasure of meeting many, start out, <i>and live</i>, on life lines which
clearly and <i>cleanly</i> recognize the fact that <i>the end is on its way</i>, and
that they are going to meet it&mdash;meet it with a brave, honest face and
a moral courage that will answer “Here” at the final round-up.</p>

<p>I presume, however, there are a few Easterners who grow
haughty, supercilious and dictatorial in proportion to the square of
the distance they are removed (by fortuitous circumstance, political
preferment or other means), from the “down-row” in the fall husking,
the spring plowing, the free lunch and other symptoms of human
industry or need.</p>

<p>This is wholly an “aside.” How it may apply to Mr. Hitchcock
must be left to readers who have a more intimate personal acquaintance
with him than have I.</p>

<p>At any rate, he came to his present official job, it appears from
most dependable information, with a “deficit”&mdash;the postal service
deficit, of course&mdash;in his mind, and he immediately began in his
vigorous, though somewhat peculiar, way to work it off. Whether
his dominating intent was to work that deficit off the department
books or merely work it off his mind, has not thus far appeared, save,
of course, to the coterie in the circle of Mr. Hitchcock’s intimates
and a somewhat numerous body of periodical and newspaper reporters
on the job in Washington.</p>

<p>The latter, of course, know everything. And what they don’t
know they go to all extremes to find out. It was, therefore, a hopeless
attempt of Mr. Hitchcock’s (though he yet seems scarcely able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
understand how so much information got to the public), to keep his
<i>scheme</i> to remove the Postoffice Department’s deficit by shunting the
<i>whole of it onto some twenty or thirty periodicals</i>&mdash;it was, I say, a
hopeless task for him to keep that scheme safely within the periphery
of the corral where herded the “influenced” and the “influencing.”</p>

<p>But why go on? Mr. Blythe in his article tells some things I
want to say and he says them so much better than I can tell them
that I will give the reader the benefit of that difference and quote
him on a number of points. As showing the studied attempt at snap
legislation in the very closing hours of Congress, Mr. Blythe says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Sixty-first Congress expired by constitutional limitation at noon on
March 4th, last. On Friday afternoon, March 3, the postoffice appropriation
bill was up for consideration in the Senate. It was being read for committee
amendments. At half past 4 page 21 of the bill was reached, and with it the
amendment proposed by the Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads to
increase the rate of second-class postage in certain specified cases and in certain
contingencies. Second-class postage is the postage paid by newspapers, magazines
and periodicals.</p>

<p>There had been several speeches. Senator Carter spoke for the amendment,
and Senators Bristow, Cummins and Owen against it. Senator Jones, of Washington,
had a few observations in favor of the amendment also. At 5 o’clock
Senator Boies Penrose, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads
and in charge of the bill, rose in his place, withdrew the amendment
increasing second-class postage, and submitted in its stead an amendment providing
for a commission to investigate the question of fact concerning the cost to
the Postoffice Department for transportation of second-class mail matter. This
amendment was unanimously adopted and the Senate proceeded to the consideration
of other sections of the bill.</p>

<p>Postmaster-General Hitchcock sat immediately behind Senator Penrose
when this happened. He had been on the floor of the Senate most of that afternoon,
and a great portion of the time for several days previous when the discussion
of the postoffice bill seemed imminent. When Senator Penrose withdrew
the amendment, the Postmaster General’s strenuously urged plan to use the taxing
power of the government to make himself a censor, with almost unlimited power
to declare what magazine and what periodical should be taxed and what magazine
and what periodical should not be taxed; to give himself the sole determining
power to decide what is a newspaper and what is a periodical&mdash;his long conceived
plan, perfected quietly, put into preliminary execution without warning to those
concerned, to be jammed through if possible, failed and failed utterly.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Blythe also refers to the fight Postmaster General Hitchcock
put up against <i>investigation</i>. Here I desire to quote him at some
length:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>The Postmaster General had enlisted the President. He had put it up to the
Republicans on the Senate Postoffice committee as an <i>Administration measure</i> to
be supported by administration men. He got the President to use the same argument.
He contrived an amendment, after much labor, so drawn as to give <i>him
the greatest</i> powers of discretion in the application of the increase in second-class
postage. He had the regulation of the magazine and periodical press of this
country in his own hands, he thought; and he was preparing to regulate it according
to his ideas&mdash;when he met with a sudden check. It was a good scheme, a
far-reaching scheme, but it didn’t go through. The Postmaster General, being a
small-bore politician, took a small-bore view of the situation. He underestimated
the force of public opinion.</p>

<p>It is my purpose to tell here the full story of Mr. Hitchcock’s attempt to put
through this legislation. Before starting, however, there is this to be said:
There never has been a minute, since this contention began, considerably more
than a year ago, when the publishers of the country have not been willing to
submit the disputed question of fact to a proper tribunal, to determine exactly
what <i>it should cost</i> the government to transport second-class mail. There never
has been a minute when the publishers of the country have not been willing to
pay exactly what, under a businesslike administration of the department, it
should cost to transport their publications. They do not desire any subsidy from
the government, and never have. The publishers have held that the statement
of Hitchcock that it costs 9 cents a pound to carry second-class matter is absurd;
and they have further held that if the postoffice department were run on proper
business principles, instead of being run as a political machine, there would be
no deficit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Mr. Hitchcock fought the idea of a commission to the last
gasp. He spent day after day at the capitol, for three weeks before the session
closed, in the corridors, in committee rooms, on the floor of the Senate, working
for his plan to increase second-class postage, granting concessions here, putting
out explanations there, assuring certain publishers they would not be taxed,
writing letters to Senators and Representatives showing how their districts or
states would not be affected, utilizing every resource of his department, of his
political connections as former chairman of the Republican National Committee,
to get support. He had the votes in the Senate, too, if he could have brought
the matter to a vote. That was where he failed. A united opposition was
organized, an opposition composed of men who think and act for themselves
and who were prepared to fight until noon on March 4.</p>

<p>When Frank H. Hitchcock, after being chairman of the Republican National
Committee in the campaign of 1908, was made Postmaster General as a reward for
his political services, he inherited, in his department, a deficit, an antiquated,
cumbersome and unbusinesslike organization, and several sets of figures. <i>Hitchcock
is young and ambitious.</i> He has been in the government service, in various
capacities, most of his life since leaving college. He was anxious to make a
record. As Postmaster General <i>he was political paymaster</i> for the administration,
to a great degree, as there are more postmasters than any one other kind of public
officials, and postmasterships are perquisites of the faithful politicians in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Senate and House of Representatives. This kept Hitchcock in politics, in a way,
for he knew what the obligations of the administration were, having made most
of them as national chairman, and he paid them off as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>He thought, too, that if he could put the Postoffice Department on a self-sustaining
basis&mdash;where it had not been for years, if ever&mdash;he would do a great
stroke for himself; and he began work along those lines. There need be no discussion
here of the methods by which he made apparent reductions in the expenses
of the department. Whether by bookkeeping or otherwise, he did make some
apparent reductions, mostly by not spending appropriated moneys, by reductions
in force, by elimination of substitute carriers and by other similar means.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock, it would seem, was a peculiarly active public
servant. Mr. Blythe also speaks of how Mr. Hitchcock got a cue from
a predecessor, Charles Emory Smith. Mr. Smith in the <i>industrious
activities of his official duties</i>, signing of reports which subordinates
wrote, vouchers for contracts and other payments, and drawing his
salary&mdash;Mr. Smith had laboriously (?) figured it out that the second-class
mail rate ought to be 7 cents a pound. Mr. Hitchcock goes
Smith two cents better. This statement of Mr Smith’s grew on Mr.
Hitchcock. “It opened the way to two things,” as Mr. Blythe ably
points out as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>First he could increase the revenue of the department if he could increase the
second-class rate; and second, he could get a whip hand over the magazine press.</p>

<p>He reported his assumed facts to the President in time for Mr. Taft’s
message to Congress, sent in in December, 1909. In that message Mr. Taft made
the statement that it costs the government 9 cents a pound to transport second-class
mail matter, the total cost being more than sixty million dollars a year, and
asked that there should be an increase in second-class rates. Mr. Taft instanced
this as a subsidy for the magazine and periodical press. Mr. Hitchcock’s report
as Postmaster General contained substantially the same statements.</p>

<p>The House Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, where the postoffice
appropriation bill originates, took cognizance of these statements by the President
and by the Postmaster General, and ordered a hearing on the matter, which was
held early in the session. The various publishers of the country, representing not
only the Periodical Publishers’ Association but many other organizations of publishers
of various classes of periodicals, sent representatives to Washington, and
there were full hearings before the committee, extending through several days.
The publishers stated their side of the case and the committee took the matter
under advisement. The House committee reported out the postoffice bill with
no recommendation of any kind in it for an increase in second-class postage; and
no separate bill providing for the increase was prepared, introduced or reported.</p>

</div>

<p>Then Mr. Blythe, under the subcaption of “Running Down the
Nine-Cent Myth,” says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>Some years previously the congress authorized what was known as the
Penrose-Overstreet Postal Commission, composed of members of the postoffice
committees of the Senate and House, of which Senator Penrose was then the
Senate chairman and the late Jesse Overstreet the House chairman. This
commission met in various places, had long hearings and made a report and prepared
a bill. Before making its report or preparing its bill the commission employed,
at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, or thereabouts, chartered
accountants and business experts to make a thorough examination into the business
methods of the postoffice department, its expenditures and its resources.
The results of the work of these examiners was incorporated in the report to Congress
by the Penrose-Overstreet commission. It is notable that this commission
<i>asked the late Postmaster General, Charles Emory Smith, of Philadelphia, who was
responsible for the statement that it cost seven cents a pound to transport second-class
mail matter, where he got his figures, and he did not remember, nor would he testify
concerning them</i>.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the Penrose-Overstreet bill, providing for the reorganization
of the Postoffice Department and the placing of that great institution on a
business instead of a political basis, was introduced in the Senate and the House,
it contained no recommendation for the increase in second-class postage, <i>because
the commission had been unable to find any figures of cost of second-class transportation
on which such an increase could justifiably be demanded</i>, even after expert
examination of the books of the department by unprejudiced men.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, I may be mistaken&mdash;<i>I</i> may be. But how, in the name
of Jehosaphat, Pan and all the other ghostly deities of antiquity, does
it happen that men like Samuel G. Blythe and hundreds of others,&mdash;men
in position to learn and <i>know</i> the facts, likewise, who have
both the ability and the courage to tell what they know&mdash;agree with
me? Why, I ask, if I <i>am</i> mistaken in what I have said and am trying
to say, do so many other men who have studied this question, all of
them probably of greater ability, most of them certainly of far greater
opportunity than have I, why, I inquire again, do they so unanimously
concur in the <i>judgment I am trying to pass on Mr. Hitchcock and his
department</i>?</p>

<p>I shall probably take the liberty, later, further to use the data
given in Mr. Blythe’s timely and informative contribution, quoting or
otherwise, for which I confidently feel he will excuse me. Just here,
however, it is fitting that the reader be given a reprint of that <i>night</i>
“rider” to which I have made so frequent reference.</p>

<p>House bill No. 31,539 brought the postoffice appropriation bill to
the Senate. In the Senate it was read twice and then on February 9,
1911, it was referred to the Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads
from which it was reported back by Senator Penrose, Chairman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the Committee, “with amendments.” It is only one of those amendments
we shall here care to consider. That one appeared on page
21 of Senate Bill (Calendar No. 1067), and the “rider” portion begins
at line 7. Following is the “rider:”</p>

<p>As previously stated, and pointed out by Senator Owen, all
amendments of character with the above are clearly in violation of
Section 7, Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. Here is
the wording of that section:</p>

<p>“All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments
as on other bills.”</p>

<p>That is plain enough, is it not, as to the Senate’s lack of right or
power to <i>originate</i> revenue-producing measures either by bill or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
amendment? A glance at lines 4 to 9 (page 22), as above quoted, will
convince even a stranger in a strange town or a market garden delegate
that this “rider” amendment, if it had passed, would <i>originate
revenue</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock <i>talked</i>, so it is alleged, that it would produce
$6,000,000 or more, thus removing that “deficit” he has had in his
brain or on his mind. Some of the best qualified men in this country
have shown, <i>and they have used Mr. Hitchcock’s own figures in doing
so</i>, that the increased mail rate as this “rider” provided would not
produce over $2,000,000 additional revenue, probably not over
$1,000,000, after paying for the added clerical and inspection service
which such a <i>discriminating classification</i> would require.</p>

<p>The reader will note (line 18 of the “rider”), that “newspapers”
are exempted from the increased tax. The reader should likewise
note that under both this “rider” and the present law, newspapers are
carried <i>free</i> to addresses inside the county of publication, save to
addressees resident of towns and cities having carrier delivery. By
this is meant that this tricky rider, as will be readily seen, leaves
the present law&mdash;<i>the one-cent a pound rate</i>&mdash;in force and applying to
all “newspapers.”</p>

<p>Just here I want to ask the thoughtful reader a question or two,
though they are somewhat tangential to the direct line of thought we
are at this point following:</p>

<p>If such a breach of constitutional law, of the legislative rules
governing Congress and of plain, common and understood justice as
was covered in this, I believe, studiedly discriminating “rider” on the
postoffice appropriation bill&mdash;if such a breach was permitted, I ask,
how long would it be, do you think, before our newspapers would be
made victims of similar restrictions and injustices?</p>

<p>In short, how long do you think it would take the gang of
conspirators (the “influenced” and the “influencing” factors in the
personnel of the conspiracy) who tried to “put over” that rider, to
make any nincompoop of a politician who chances to be, or who
may become, Postmaster General a <i>censor of all periodical literature</i>,
newspapers as well as magazines, <i>published in this country</i>?</p>

<p>In this connection another thought comes which I desire to pass
on to the reader. If such censorship is permitted, such discriminating,
<i>abrogative</i> legislation is tolerated, how long will it be, think you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
before our “banking interests,” our “steel interests,” our “packing
interests,” our “hide and leather interests,” our “rail transportation
interests” go into the periodical business?</p>

<p>Each of these have the country covered&mdash;yes, flooded&mdash;with
agents. No trouble whatsoever for them to get the postal department’s
required “bona fide” subscription list and thus be “entered” <i>at the
one-cent second-class rate</i>.</p>

<p>“Will they carry advertising?” Later, yes.</p>

<p><i>When our children are paying the cost of our blunder they will be
advertising each other and&mdash;at the one-cent a pound rate.</i></p>

<p>Think it over and&mdash;well, wake up. If necessary, get <i>cogently
brisk</i> with that Senator or Congressman of yours. At least, let him
know that you are on the job as well as he and that you <i>understand
the job as well as he</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, the “steerers” and “cappers” for this press-muzzling
and official censorship game will tell you that such entrance of the
“interests” into our literary field is “quite impossible;” that “the
postal laws prohibit it;” that “it would be a foolish waste of money
on their part,” and a score or more of other equally silly, equally false
and equally “steered” arguments.</p>

<p>You can take it from me <i>flat</i> that the man&mdash;<i>any man</i>&mdash;who hands
you that sort of talk is either <i>hired</i> to talk it or he is mentally unsound.</p>

<p>The “interests” are <i>already</i> in the periodical business. They own,
or control, at this hour, hundreds of newspapers, magazines and other
periodicals. This is a matter of common knowledge to every citizen
who <i>reads when he is awake</i>. Not only that, but the interests, banking,
industrial, transportation, etc., have gone into the book publishing
business (the bound book), <i>and hundreds of thousands of copies
of their capping “literature” have been distributed to the people</i>, either
free or at a price far below cost of production.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the “interests” are annually (<i>now</i>), distributing
millions, in the aggregate <i>hundreds</i> of millions, of circular letters
and circular matter, under seal and open circular-matter sheets,
pamphlets, etc., first and third class, at a cost of <i>eight cents a pound
or more</i>.</p>

<p>So, I repeat, the man who attempts to controvert my previous
statement as to the intent, <i>the ulterior motive</i>, of the conspirators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
backing that rider to the 1911 postoffice appropriation bill is either
hired&mdash;bought&mdash;or is a fool.</p>

<p>It is one of his easiest “stunts” for any writer to produce a
“promotion” story or article. For instance: The “Packing Interest,”
monthly or weekly, can print three or four “nice” stories. One, say,
about “Lucy and Her Window Garden,” another about “High Light
Pink, the Broncho Buster,” etc., etc. Then can follow a “literary”
write-up of how “Jones Rose From a Wheelbarrow Man to Foreman in
a Steel Mill,” or about how “Cruiser Miller Dropped His Blazing Ax
and Became Partner in a Great Lumber Company,” etc., etc. After
this may come a “Home Department,” and then a few local or “plant”
news items.</p>

<p>In the first, your wife and mine will be told how to make her
currants (not her currency) jell; how to make children “bread
winners;” how to “crochet an art tidy,” or how to “Subsist a Family
of Five on Thirty-Nine Cents a Day.”</p>

<p>In the “Local” or “Plant” news may appear some explanation of
how Crawloffski, who had lost a leg in service, is “improving in the
hospital” (County), and “is under the competent care of the company’s
physician,” of the promotion of “Mr. James Field, formerly
‘run-way driver,’ to the position of ‘hammer-man’ in the slaughter
pen, with an increase of $2.80 a week in salary.”</p>

<p>Of course, it will be understood that I am not giving the entire
scope and plan of an “Interest’s” periodical. The point I am trying
to establish is, that no “Interest” periodical will, for a time at
any rate, advertise <i>its own interests</i>, save as <i>news matter</i>, and that each
“Interest” can <i>and will</i> advertise the others&mdash;<i>the mutual interests</i>&mdash;and
do it, too, at the <i>cent-a-pound rate</i> and without violating any
postal law now existent.</p>

<p>I will now return to Mr. Hitchcock’s activity and arguments
for this “rider” to that postoffice appropriation bill. I call
it “his,” as, from the evidence, I am forced to the conclusion that it
originated with him. Most certainly he nursed it and pushed it
forward with the urgent solicitude which a fond father would display
in advancing his first-born or favorite scion. The excerpts which I
have taken from Mr. Blythe clearly evidence that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock is on record as stating that it costs “9.23 cents a
pound to transport and handle second-class mail matter.” I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
quoting from memory. Maybe he did not include “handling,” and
put 9.23 cents per pound as the cost of transportation only. At all
events I remember that one writer, with keen perception and a robust
sense of the humor of things, as well as the justice involved, pointed
out the fact that any of the competing railroads between New York
city and Chicago (easily proven to be twice the “average mail haul”),
would carry Mr. Taft, our 300-pound “good fellow” President, the
“run” at less than 9 cents a pound. Incidentally the writer pointed
out these facts: President Taft would have a sleeping berth or
compartment, a porter in attendance, smoking room accommodations,
likewise barber, manicure, buffet, library and dining-room services
and conveniences. The Chief Executive would of course put himself
on board and “discharge” himself at the terminal station.</p>

<p>How about 300 pounds of second-class mail matter, say some
monthly New York periodical? This is brought to the mail car,
wrapped and directed to destination, Chicago for instance, to keep the
comparison clear and fair. It is dumped on the floor in a corner of a
mail car, with all the intermediate station deliveries atop of it or
stacked about it, and at Chicago it is tumbled off to the publisher’s
agent or salesman. <i>That is all the service rendered</i> by either the railroads
or the Postoffice Department in handling that 300 pounds of
second-class mail matter.</p>

<p><i>Yet the Postmaster General says it costs the government 9.23 cents
a pound to render such service!</i></p>

<p>Is not that rather jarring to one’s exalted opinion of Mr. Hitchcock’s
all-round, comprehending knowledge of a just and fair mail
haulage rate? If it does not jar the reader he should take his thinking
apparatus to the cobbler and have it half-soled.</p>

<p>A glance at freight schedules will show any reader that live stock,
cattle, hogs or sheep, are carried from Chicago to New York, Boston
or other eastern destination at only a small fraction of his dead-mail
rate. Again, while double-deck live stock cars are in extensive use
on long hauls, the stock is not corded up on the decks as much of the
second-class mail is piled up. Not only that, but the live stock must
be <i>watered and fed in transit</i>.</p>

<p>The rail rates for the carriage of dead-freight makes Mr.
Hitchcock’s 9.23 cents a pound, which he figured as the cost to the
government of carriage and handling second-class mail, read so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
absurd as to be a joke, were the purpose and purport of his
statement not so grave and serious as they are. Even the 4-cent
rate that he and a coterie of his friends tried to put over in the
Senate rider&mdash;$80.00 a ton for carrying dead weights the average mail
haul, and dumping it off at destination&mdash;is a ridiculous charge.</p>

<p>Why, the express companies are carrying hundreds of tons daily
of dead-freight over such average haul for less than a cent a pound;
yes, they are carrying tons of second-class <i>mail matter</i> and carrying it
<i>at one-half a cent a pound</i>. It has been cited by Mr. Hearst and other
publishers that certain railroads carry second-class mail matter over
fast freight runs for about one-quarter of a cent a pound. In this
connection another thought presents itself: Did, or did not, Mr.
Hitchcock, at the time he was pushing his “rider” in the Senate, have
any adequate knowledge of the amount, of second-class mail matter
which publishers were then sending by express and fast freight? If
he had such knowledge, then he must have known of the fact that
<i>thousands of tons</i> of periodicals are now carried by the railroads and
express companies at a rate <i>lower</i> than the government’s mail charge
of one-cent a pound. If Mr. Hitchcock had such knowledge when he
was handing his string-talk to President Taft, having his “heart-to-hearts”
with certain senators, I wonder if he intimated to them what
must necessarily happen to the second class mail division and to that
deficit which, apparently at least, has so continuously, likewise so
effusively and diffusively, worried him?</p>

<p>If the fast freights and express are now taking thousands of tons
of second-class matter from the government in competition with the
one-cent a pound rate, how many thousands of tons more would they
take from the government if the latter advanced its rate to four cents
a pound? And what effect would the withdrawal of so vast a tonnage
from the government’s second-class service have upon the deficit our
solicitous Postmaster General has kept himself so exercised about&mdash;that
$6,000,000, or, to be exact, using Mr. Hitchcock’s own figures,
$5,881,481.95? That deficit, if converted into cash, would barely
furnish parade money to our army for a month. If the Atlantic
squadron undertook a junket with such financial backing its progress
would probably end by rounding the Statue of Liberty at the entrance
of New York harbor. If Mr. Hitchcock’s attempt to put up a four-cent
rate on periodicals had succeeded, thus forcing the prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
publishers to find cheaper means of carriage and distribution, his
$6,000,000 would have soared upward to a point making it worth very
serious consideration.</p>

<h3>DEFICITS AFFECTED BY SECOND-CLASS TONNAGE.</h3>

<p>In this connection I desire to show that deficits in the federal
postal service are largely governed by the tonnage of second-class
matter carried, the greater such tonnage the smaller the deficit. To
do this I shall take the liberty to quote from the “Inland Printer,”
probably the most widely read periodical among the printing crafts,
as it certainly is one of the best informed and most carefully edited
journals of any in matters relating to the publication and distribution
of periodical literature. The article speaks of several points pertinent
to our subject and is so instructively written that I know my readers
will appreciate it in its entirety. If the publishers of the periodical
will pardon my wholesale appropriation of their article, I am confident
my readers will do the same. The article is of date March, 1911, and
was written by Wilmer Atkinson, whose permission I should also ask
for reprinting it in toto:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In 1860 the postal deficit was $10,652,543; in 1910 it was $5,848,566. The
postage rate was four times greater in 1860 than now.</p>

<p>Coming down twelve years to 1872 the total weight of second-class matter
was that year less than 65,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Now it is 817,428,141 pounds, more than twelve times greater.</p>

<p>Then the postage rate was four times what it is now.</p>

<p>Then the gross revenue was $21,915,426; now it is $224,128,657, more than
ten times as much.</p>

<p>Then there was no rural free delivery; now that system costs $36,923,737.</p>

<p>Then there were no registered letters; now there are 42,053,574 a year.</p>

<p>Then there were issued $48,515,532 of domestic money orders; now there
are issued $547,993,641.</p>

<p>Then postmasters were paid $5,121,665; now they are paid $27,514,362, and
their clerks are paid $38,035,456.62.</p>

<p>Then city delivery cost but little; now it costs $31,805,485.28.</p>

<p>In 1872 there were issued of stamps, stamped envelopes and wrappers less
than $18,000,000 (there were no postal cards); now are issued, including postal
cards, $202,064,887.96, more than ten times as much.</p>

<p>Observe that the weight of second-class matter is 752,428,141 pounds
greater than in 1872, costing therefore (according to some official mathematicians),
more than 9 cents a pound for transportation, or a total of $67,718,532.69.
The deficit for 1910 is almost identical with that of 1872.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">1885-1910</p>

<p>As late as 1885 the government income from the issue of stamps, stamped
envelopes and wrappers and postal cards was $35,924,137.70.</p>

<p>In 1910 it was $202,064,887.96, more than five times as much.</p>

<p>The number of registered letters issued in 1885 was 11,043,256; in 1910 it
was 40,151,797.</p>

<p>The amount of money orders issued rose from $117,858,921 in 1885 to $498,699,637
in 1910.</p>

<p>The total postal receipts rose from $42,560,844 in 1885 to $224,128,657 in
1910, an increase of $181,567,813.</p>

<p>The postage rate on second-class matter in 1885 was double what it is now.</p>

<p>During the intervening period the weight of second-class matter had increased
about 600,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Now we will get down a little closer in this business and see what has
happened within the last five years.</p>

<p class="center">1906-1911</p>

<p>In 1906 there was a gain in weight of second-class matter of 41,674,086
pounds; in that year the deficit was $10,516,999.</p>

<p>In 1907 there was a gain in weight of 52,616,336 pounds&mdash;11,000,000 pounds
more than in 1906; the deficit was reduced to $6,653,283.</p>

<p>In 1908 there was a <i>loss</i> instead of gain in weight of second-class matter of
18,079,292 pounds; the deficit went up to $16,873,223, an increase over the year
before of more than $10,000,000.</p>

<p>In 1909 there was only a slight gain in weight of 28,367,298 pounds; the
deficit went up to $17,441,719.</p>

<p>In 1910 there was a gain in weight of 94,865,884 pounds, the largest ever
known; and the deficit dropped to $5,848,566.88.</p>

<p>From 1906 to 1910 there were 198,863,387 pounds increase in the weight
of second-class matter; the deficit was $4,668,432.12 less in 1910 than in 1906.</p>

<p>The impression is prevalent that the amount paid for railway transportation
was cut down the past year, but the truth is that the railroads were paid $44,654,514.97,
the railway mail service and the postoffice car service cost $24,065,218.88,
a total of $68,719,733.85, which is more by a half million than was paid in
1909, and over $7,000,000 more than was paid in 1906.</p>

<p>It is claimed that there is no definite relation between deficits and second-class
matter; very well, the foregoing are the official figures; let them speak for
themselves.</p>

<p>In the whole history of the Postoffice Department, neither an increase of
second-class matter nor a reduction of the postage rate has ever increased deficits,
no matter what burdens have been piled upon the service in the way of an extension
of city delivery, the establishment of rural free delivery, the multiplication
in number and increase of pay of officials, increase of government free matter,
increase of railroad and other transportation charges, nor an increase in the obstructive
energies of postal officials directed against the publishing business.
(See In Memoriam, page 49.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>It has come to be generally understood and conceded that second-class
matter originates mail of the other classes. The Postal Commission testifies that
“No sane man will deny that second-class matter is the immediate cause of great
quantities of first-class matter.” Mr. Madden and Mr. Lawshe said the same
thing. Meyer said that “It is known that second-class matter is instrumental in
originating a large amount of other classes of mail matter.” To what extent
this is so can not be determined with exactitude, but the official figures given
throw a flood of light on the subject.</p>

<p>There are four classes of (paid) mail matter&mdash;first, second, third and fourth.
The first comprises letters and postals, the second newspapers and periodicals, the
third circulars, and the fourth merchandise.</p>

<p>How, of themselves, could the first, third and fourth classes develop faster
than the growth of population? Does not their extension depend upon the business
energy and the intellectual activity of the people, and in turn do not these
depend very largely upon the circulation of the public press?</p>

<p>Will it, therefore, be deemed unreasonable to conclude that of the $202,064,887.96
of stamps sold for the first, third and fourth classes of mail matter
last year, $150,000,000 of it originated immediately, remotely and cumulatively
from the second class? How else than in some such way can we account for the
prodigious development of the postal business, which has outrun population
sixfold or more?</p>

<p>The late Senator Dolliver, at the American Periodical Association’s banquet,
at the New Willard hotel, at Washington, a year ago, said: “I look upon every
one of your little advertisements as a traveling salesman for the industries of the
United States.”</p>

<p>The amazing development of the industries of the country is in a large
measure due to second-class matter; the great increase of second-class matter is
due to the low postage rate; and the wonderful expansion of the postal establishment
is based chiefly upon the widespread distribution of newspapers and periodicals.</p>

<p>The foregoing figures are respectfully submitted; they are official; and their
significance can be interpreted by any intelligent and thoughtful person. In the
presence of these figures, is it too much to claim that the government has never
lost a dollar in transporting second-class mail, that it is by far the most profitable
of any, and that, were it withdrawn or greatly curtailed by an increase of rate,
the postal establishment would collapse into bankruptcy?</p>

<p>In view, also, of the foregoing figures it is hoped that the government will
assume a less antagonistic attitude toward the publishing business, and encourage
and promote the circulation of the public press rather than repress and
curtail it. Its obstructive course has been pursued too long, having no basis in
justice, business foresight, or common sense.</p>

<p>Let there be a realization and an awakening!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">IN MEMORIAM.</p>

<p>During the last fiscal postal year the death list of publications
footed up to 4,229. Of these, 504 died a-bornin, that is, were denied
entry; the others&mdash;3,725&mdash;were papers that had been established.</p>

<p>In the decade from 1901 to 1910, inclusive, 11,563 publications
were strangled at birth (denied entry), and of established papers that
died there were 32,060.</p>

<p>How many of these were forced to give up the struggle for existence
on account of the hard conditions imposed by the government, we
have no means of knowing. It is not found in the annual reports. It is
beyond question that with sample copies cut off and necessary credit for
subscriptions forbidden, no publishers without large cash capital to draw
from can start and keep going in competition with old established papers.</p>

<p>Why at this time, when the people are trying to get rid of monopoly,
the government should thus build one up, is hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>We are informed that the rule in regard to expired subscriptions
“has met with strong approval and continues to grow in favor with
publishers and the public generally.” This statement is made by the newly
installed Third Assistant Postmaster General, but it is a delusion which
Mr. Britt has unfortunately inherited from his predecessor. It may
be true as to those benefited by the monopoly, but not as to those
who have been put down and out. “Dead men tell no tales.”</p>

</div>

<p>I had intended to omit that “In Memoriam.” Then I carefully
read it over. The appalling slaughter of the “innocents” which it
exposes was so new to me, news of such a tragic nature in the domain
of periodical publishing, that I then and there changed my mind.
I am of the opinion that the news conveyed in its five brief paragraphs
will be as new and as surprising to most of my readers as it was to me.
Think of 42,623 publications put out of business in <i>ten years</i>? Of 4,229
sent to the commercial&mdash;in most instances, probably, to the <i>financial</i>&mdash;junk
pile in one year&mdash;last year? Then think of the causes this conscientious
writer holds chargeable for a large share of the slaughter!</p>

<h3>ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>We will now revert to the bold attempt made in presenting that
rider amendment to the postoffice appropriation bill to breach the federal
constitution, following which we will take up some of Mr. Hitchcock’s
efforts to show how much or how little he knows about the
business of publishing and distributing magazines and other periodical
literature.</p>

<p>First let us inquire if Mr. Hitchcock and the coterie backing that
Senate “rider” <i>knew</i> that, under the Constitution, all measures for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
raising federal revenue must originate in the Lower House of Congress?
One scarcely dares conclude they were so densely ignorant as that.
Then, was theirs a deliberate, calculated attempt to breach the constitutional
prerogatives and rights of the Lower House? Did they figure
upon putting through that vicious rider in the congested closing hours
of Congress? I call them the <i>crooked</i> hours of Congress. Did those
backers of that rider <i>hope</i> that Senators and Congressmen would
overlook or fail to read that rider, hope that so many would be so fully
occupied by the swan-song chorus being sung during those closing
hours that they would not notice that “rider” jumping the constitutional
hurdles?</p>

<p>Now, if either one of the last assigned reasons is valid, a word
stronger than “ignorance” should apply to such tricky, treacherous
action, whether it is practiced by Senators, Congressmen, cabinet
chiefs or chiefs higher up. One greatly dislikes to apply a fitting
term to such ulterior motives as lead high and respected public
officials to breach the constitution by trickery about on a level with
that of the sneak thief or with that of a “con” man who thinks he has
done his full duty by the people when he has sold Reuben the painted
brick. But how could Mr. Hitchcock and those Senators co-operating
with him be ignorant of the plain letter of the law and supported
by a long line of precedents in both the Senate and the House?</p>

<p>As to the Senate precedents for the House’s right to originate all
measures for the raising of revenues, Mr. Henry H. Gilfry, Chief Clerk
of the Senate, compiled in 1871 a work entitled “Decisions on Points
of Order with Phraseology in the United States Senate.” Mr.
Gilfry cites the attempt of the Senate to repeal the income tax. The
House returned the bill to the Senate with a reminder that the
Constitution “vests in the House of Representatives the sole power
to originate such measures.” Mr. Gilfry cites many other precedents.</p>

<p>In 1905 the Senate tried to originate revenues by amendment to
the postoffice appropriation bill. That amendment was very
similar to the “rider” of Mr. Hitchcock. I will here reprint it:</p>

<p>“That hereafter the rate of postage on packages of books or
merchandise mailed at the distributing postoffice of any rural free
delivery to a patron on said route shall be three cents for each
pound or any fraction thereof. This rate shall apply only to packages
deposited at the local postoffice for delivery to patrons on routes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
emanating from that office, or collected by rural carriers for delivery
to the office from which the route emanates, and not to mail transmitted
from one office to another, and shall not apply to packages
exceeding 5 pounds in weight.”</p>

<p>The House brought that measure to conference and flatly <i>refused
to recognize the power of the Senate in the premises</i>. The Senate
receded and the amendment was killed.</p>

<p>“Hinds’ Precedents of the House of Representatives” is a recognized
authority. In Chapter XLII, Vol. 2, under the caption,
“Prerogatives of the House as to Revenue Legislation,” Mr. Hinds
cites many instances in which the House had invariably insisted upon
the <i>exclusive exercise of its rights as defined in Section 7, Article 1, of
the Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinds cites in all one hundred and twenty-five precedents,
each of which raises the same point of order as was raised in debating
Mr. Hitchcock’s late “rider” and on each of which the House <i>maintained
its right to originate all bills for raising revenues</i>.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that some of Mr. Hitchcock’s supporters were
men of experience, skilled parliamentarians, in view of the fact that
some of them were trained lawyers, and in view of the further fact
that the works both of Mr. Hinds and of Mr. Gilfry are on file in the
reference libraries of the Senate and House and probably in most of
the departments, how, I ask, in view of the above facts, can either Mr.
Hitchcock or any of his supporters enter a valid plea of <i>ignorance</i>
of the fact that their attempt to put over that rider was contravening
the constitutional rights and prerogatives of the House?</p>

<p>No, they were not ignorant. In my judgment, as based upon the
reports which have reached me, that “rider” was a deliberate frame-up
and its architects were a few conspirators who sought by means
of that rider either to put certain periodicals out of business or <i>force
them to print what they were told to publish</i>.</p>

<p>Possibly I may be in error as to this, but the careful observation
of the best informed and most experienced correspondents on the
Washington assignment, as well as a number of Senators and Congressmen,
have, in reports made, supplied ample evidence to warrant my
statement to the effect that there was a collusive understanding
among a few people to present that “rider” in the closing hours of
the session with the hope that in the rush of affairs it might escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
notice and go through. And that hope was born of an ulterior purpose
to get even with some monthly and weekly publications&mdash;publications
of <i>independent</i> thought and voice and which have for several
years been <i>telling the truth</i> about certain Senators and Congressmen.
These independent periodicals have also been telling a rapidly growing
multitude of eager readers the cold, unvarnished facts about some
corporations and corporate interests which, it is generally believed
and openly charged, are represented in federal legislation and in cabinet
and other official circles in Washington <i>by several of the very
men who were so actively supporting Mr. Hitchcock in pushing his
“rider” over the legislative course</i>.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the history of that rider may be presented at
this point. The Penrose-Overstreet bill was before the House in the
early part of 1910. It carried no recommendation of an increased
rate on second-class matter. This Penrose-Overstreet bill was,
however, reintroduced in the House by Congressman Weeks, of
Massachusetts, Chairman of the House Postoffice Committee, and by
Senator Carter in the Senate. The House refused either to approve
or take action on Mr. Hitchcock’s recommendation. After consideration,
the Senate approved the House bill. That bill carried no
recommendation for an increase in second-class postage rates. Not
a single member of the Senate during the debate suggested nor
introduced any bill or amendment recommending such increase.</p>

<p>In his message of December, 1910, President Taft recommended
an increase in the second-class mail rates. His recommendation was
couched in language very similar to that used in his message of
December, 1909.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Blythe, from whom I have previously quoted extendedly,
says some pertinent things in commenting on the situation
at this point in our brief outline of how this “rider” got mounted for
a lap or two and then was blanketed in the home-stretch:</p>

<p>“The Postmaster General had not been idle in the matter. He
had it on his mind. Moreover, his party had been defeated at the
polls in the previous November and about the only Republicans who
were successful were Progressive Republicans against whom the
President had admitted, in his famous Norton-Iowa letter, he had
been discriminating and for whom Mr. Hitchcock had no sympathy.
The policies, and in many cases the individuals, in the progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
movement had had large support from the magazines and periodicals;
and before that, the reactionaries who had ultimately been defeated,
had been assailed because of their misdeeds.”</p>

<p>There is a lot of bone and sinew in that. Of course, both the
President and his Postmaster General wanted to make good; wanted,
as I have previously intimated, to get rid of those pestiferous independent
periodicals which had been so conspicuous and powerful in
unhorsing some of their stand-pat friends in the elections of November.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock is not one of the sort of men who rush in
where angels fear to tread. He is quite a general. He can make the
waiting tactics of General McClellan, it would seem, apply beautifully
to a political maneuver. He can wait and bide his time. At any
rate, he waited. He waited until the President and other friends had
worked that announced method of “discriminating” against the
progressives, the so-called “insurgents,” to the end of appointing a
Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, the personnel of
which suited Mr. Hitchcock’s quietly nursed purpose&mdash;in fact suited
him as well as if he had selected the committee himself. Mr. Hitchcock,
however, still waited, and while he waited, the House Committee
had been appointed and was engaged in considering the
postoffice appropriation bill. This House Committee held numerous
sessions and gave hearings to many newspapermen and to publishers
of periodicals. It went over the entire field of requirement in the
government postal services and appears to have gone into the subject
of second-class mail rates and the cost of its transportation and handling
most carefully and thoroughly. The result of its deliberations was
to tender to the House a bill carrying, as previously stated, an
appropriation of some $258,000,000 for the year’s salaries, maintenance
and operation of the Postoffice Department, a sum which
must certainly appear liberal to any informed reader.</p>

<p>In this connection, two points stand out in bold relief. First:&mdash;When
the House bill covering the 1911 appropriations for the Postoffice
Department was passed and advanced to the Senate, <i>it carried
no provision or recommendation for an increase of the second-class
postage rates</i>.</p>

<p>Second:&mdash;As previously stated the House committee held many
sessions while considering and preparing its 1911 Postoffice Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
appropriation bill, and <i>at no session of that committee did Mr.
Hitchcock urge an increase in the second-class postage rates. He made
no propositions or recommendations to that committee touching on
increases in the second-class mail rate.</i></p>

<p><i>In fact he made no proposition of any sort to that committee. Nor
did he submit any statements or figures to that committee, other than
those contained in his 1910 report and in the President’s message.</i></p>

<p>Rather a queer procedure that, is it not? Especially is it queer,
likewise suggestive, in a man who, for two years, had been running
with anti-skidding tires on and the high-speed lever pushed clear
down, in a wild chase to capture an increase in the second-class mail
rate.</p>

<p>That is the way it looks to The Man on the Ladder, anyway.</p>

<p>Why did Mr. Hitchcock so completely ignore that House committee?
Or why, at most, did his attitude, when present at any of its
sessions, manifest so little interest as almost to indicate an <i>indifference</i>
as to what was done or not done? Why, again, was Mr. Hitchcock
so inactive, so void of suggestions and recommendations when before
that branch of federal legislative authority with which he knew must
originate <i>all</i> measures for the raising of revenues?</p>

<p><i>Why?</i> To that question there appears, to The Man on the Ladder,
but one valid answer. <i>Mr. Hitchcock was waiting.</i></p>

<p>When the House bill was sent to the Senate and referred to the
Senate Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, it appears from
reports of people whose business it is to watch things done and doing
at Washington, D. C, that Postmaster General Hitchcock livened up
a bit, being careful, however, not to put any noticeable pressure on
his high-speed lever <i>until those meddlesome publishers had left town
and were well away</i>.</p>

<p>These publishers, knowing the constitutional prerogatives of the
Lower House, considered matters safe and settled when the House
bill making appropriations for the Postoffice Department was adopted
and advanced to the Senate. They knew it carried no section advancing
second-class postage rates nor any recommendations favoring
such advance. With the publishers that ended it. But they failed
to consider Mr. Hitchcock. His wiles and ways were, it appears,
neither understood nor even suspicioned by those publishers. So,
confident and content, they gathered up their belongings, packed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
their grips, paid their hotel bills and hied away to their several
homes. Then it was that Mr. Hitchcock got busy with that
discriminatingly selected committee of the Senate&mdash;the Committee on
Postoffices and Postroads.</p>

<p>To see how “discriminating” some one or more persons had been
in selecting that committee, let us look over its membership. At
its head, as Chairman, sat Boies Penrose. He is the reputed Republican
boss of Pennsylvania and an “organization” man. So is President
Taft an organization man. Therefore Senator Penrose is an Administration
man to the last ditch&mdash;that is, of course, if the administration
is Republican. Mr. Hitchcock is also an organization
man, and if both the President and his Postmaster General wanted
this “rider” turned loose on the senate tanbark, Mr. Penrose was
willing to go along with them. The other members of the committee
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>Republicans:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Scott, of West Virginia.</li>
<li>Burrows, of Michigan.</li>
<li>Dick, of Ohio.</li>
<li>Crane, of Massachusetts.</li>
<li>Guggenheim, of Colorado.</li>
</ul>

<p>Democrats:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Taliaferro, of Florida.</li>
<li>Bankhead, of Alabama.</li>
<li>Taylor, of Tennessee.</li>
<li>Terrell, of Georgia.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will scrutinize that list and see how the members fared at
the November election. The first four Republicans and the first Democrat
as named in the list were defeated at the last senatorial selection&mdash;in
fact they were repudiated by the states they had been representing
or misrepresenting, as the reader cares to take it. As these defeated
toga-smudgers attributed their overthrow largely to newspaper and
other periodical attacks upon them, Mr. Hitchcock naturally found
them in line for anything he wanted to visit upon those offensive
publications.</p>

<p>Of the other Republicans, Crane, is reputed to be lugging around
with him a large-sized aspiration to be Republican leader in the
Senate. If he cashes that ambition, he must necessarily stand pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with the President and Hitchcock, in spite of the alleged fact that
Senator Crane does not carry an over-load of esteem for said Hitchcock.
The other left-over Republican member of the committee,
Guggenheim, would not be worth mentioning were it not for the fact
that the methods pursued by himself and his friends in his elevation
to senatorial honors have put him in the class almost removed from
criticism. Those methods received much caustic consideration from
newspapers and other periodicals. Simon Guggenheim, though
reputed to be noticeably obtuse in comprehension and decidedly
pachydermatous of integument, is probably neither so dull nor so
thick of skin as not to have felt and to have remembered the exposure
the magazines made of the methods they asserted were used to secure
his toga; methods, it was asserted, which virtually bought his
“friends,” both those in and those out of Colorado’s legislature.
Yes, Simon probably remembers those exposures and the sources
from which they emanated.</p>

<p>Entirely aside from that fact, Simon Guggenheim is a dyed-in-the-wool
Administration man. In fact, if reports be true, and his
record in the Senate appears to justify the reports, Senator Guggenheim
could not be other than an Administration man. First, it is
said, there are “official” motives and reasons for his being such, and,
second, that his intellectual equipment is so out of repair, or so lacking
in native operating power, as virtually to disqualify him for any part
or position save that of a nonentity in legislative procedure and
affairs.</p>

<p>So Senator Simon “Gugg” must necessarily stand with the
President and the Postmaster General on the “rider” amendment as
on any other proposition <i>they</i> wanted to forward.</p>

<p>As to the hold-over or returned Democratic members of that
committee little needs be said as the Democrats were in the minority
anyway. Senator Bankhead is quite generally recognized as a congenial,
obliging and accommodating politician. In all probability,
he would not enter any strenuous objections to Mr. Hitchcock’s
proposed amendment, provided a hint was given him that the President
approved it. That such hint was handed around quite freely
before the committee’s report was submitted to the Senate is a matter
of common knowledge.</p>

<p>Senator Taylor first voted for the rider amendment. Later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
however, when he neared Jericho, the scales appear to have fallen
from his eyes and he then saw things differently. At any rate he
later voted against the amendment.</p>

<p>Senator Terrell of Georgia was ill, and therefore not present when
action was had. It will be seen, then, that the Postmaster General
<i>had his “discriminating” committee</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock began his advance on that committee February
1st. He approached certain of its members on the 1st and 2nd and
informed them, in effect, that he wanted them to urge a second-class
amendment to the postoffice appropriation bill, which the committee
had under consideration. He, it is reported, also assured these
senators that President Taft most earnestly desired that an increase
be made in second-class rates. He got a committee appointed, consisting
of Senators Carter, Crane and others to confer with the President
regarding the matter. Owing, however, to the pending of other
legislation in the Senate (the ship subsidy bill in particular), the
matter dragged along until the 8th of February. During the delay,
Hitchcock made sure of the committee by nailing down Penrose,
Crane, Burrows, Carter, Scott, Bankhead, Taliaferro, Dick and Simon
“Gugg.” On the date last named, Senators Carter and Crane went
to the White House “by request” to confer with the President. The
President, it is said on authority, flatly told the two Senators that
they “must” put the amendment into the bill. It is also reported,
and to their credit, that the two Senators argued strenuously against
the expediency of inserting it, pointing out the fact that such an
amendment would go out on a point of order under Senate Rule
XVI. Mr. Hitchcock was present throughout the conference.
Incidentally, it may be likewise noted that Vice-President Sherman
dropped in, quite “by accident” of course, but he showed no hesitancy,
it is said, in participating in the discussion as actively as
Postmaster General Hitchcock had been doing from the beginning of
the conference. While the President and his Postmaster General
were arguing with the Senators to prove to them how important the
action was to the Administration; why the “rider” must go into the
bill as an amendment, and probably why it was “time for all good
organization men to come to the aid of the party,” Mr. Sherman
probably dropped a few timely hints to the effect of how easy it
would be, with the gavel in his hands and a quick, true and <i>favoring</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
eye for floor recognitions, <i>to get around</i> Senate Rule XVI. In the
end, Senators Carter and Crane were won over and a meeting of
the Postoffice and Postroads Committee was called for the afternoon
of the same day, Wednesday, February 8th, 1911.</p>

<p>When the committee got together it was found that there was
not a single proposition of any sort relating to second-class mail rates
before it for consideration. Neither was there a written suggestion,
recommendation or report bearing upon that subject before them.
Mr. Hitchcock, however, was present at this committee meeting.
He formulated his proposition and the committee went into session,
the discussion being led by Senators Carter and Crane, who had become
“convinced” against their best judgment if not against their will, in
the forenoon of the same day, to support the amendment. The
discussion lasted for several hours, with Mr. Hitchcock’s deficit
occasionally buzzing as his wheels went round. Then the committee
adjourned until the next afternoon, February 9th.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock left the room after the discussion and, it is said,
went immediately and reported to the President. Upon learning that
the attitude of the committee was unfriendly, the President at once
began to turn on more current, not hesitating to use his patronage
club in doing so, reports say.</p>

<p>The committee met, as agreed at its adjournment. <i>Mr. Hitchcock
was present with his rider amendment all written up and fully
varnished and frescoed, and in two hours Mr. Hitchcock’s rider amendment
was tacked onto the bill</i>, in wording substantially as it appears on
another page.</p>

<p>Then the real fight began. Hitchcock stood to his embrazured
guns, to his reprisal rider, throughout the entire engagement. As an
evidence that it was his rider, or his and President Taft’s, I desire
here to present to the reader points in proof:</p>

<p>That picked “discriminating” Senate committee had a majority
of defeated or otherwise disgruntled politicians. They were defeated
or disgruntled because certain independent periodicals had, figuratively
speaking, peeled the varnish and smooth epidermis off them, thus
exposing their decayed or decaying carcasses to a public not only able
to read and understand, but a public <i>willing</i> to read and understand.</p>

<p>I will offer a few other established facts. Mr. Hitchcock, during
the closing days of the fight, <i>devoted nearly his entire time to pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and advocating his measure, his carefully prepared scheme</i>. A canvass
of the Senate was made, which canvass led Mr. Hitchcock to believe
he had the votes to put his rider over the course a sure winner. In
that, however, he was mistaken. A number of the Senators had
wised up as to the real purpose and purport of that rider and, in the
canvass, they <i>handed back to him a little of his own peculiar brand of
jolly, which he had delivered to them in unbroken packages, freight
prepaid</i>.</p>

<p>After his canvass, Mr. Hitchcock still kept his oil tank well
filled, and his “deficit” playing rag-time to boost his rider along.
He even kept his deficit buzzer going after nearly everyone about the
Capitol <i>knew</i> that Senators La Follette, Bristow, Owen, Gore,
Cummins, Bourne, Clapp, Beveridge, Borah, Brown and others intended
to <i>talk his rider into the ditch</i> or talk the postoffice appropriation
bill into the Sixty-second Congress.</p>

<p>Yes, Postmaster General Hitchcock, though neither a very competent
nor scrupulous tactician, nor an able manager for any large
business, industrial or other, is a <i>good fighter</i>. That much must be
said for him. When a man fights to the last ditch for a lost or losing
cause or purpose as he fought for his “rider,” that man has courage,
nerve, whatever we may call it, in him. At any rate it is a quality
which commands respect and the man possessing such a quality
will receive his just meed of respect wherever men <i>are</i> men.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock worked up a vigorous support for what The Man
on the Ladder considers not only an objectionable cause, but a cause
viciously dangerous to our form of government, to the material welfare
of our people, to their educational advancement as well as to
their moral and intellectual betterment.</p>

<p>That is the reason he opposes the purpose of this rider amendment
and the methods used to enact it into law. In brief, that is why this
book has been written. How Mr. Hitchcock secured a following,
even for the brief period his followers followed, for such a cause and
the methods used to advance it is as difficult for me to work out or
solve as the “Pigs-in-Clover” puzzle or the “How Old Is Ann”
problem. He must certainly have learned some new “holds” or
tricks in what Sewell Ford calls “the confidential tackle,” or he could
not have secured so many “falls” in so short a time for a cause that
was bad and for methods even worse, if such were possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we will take up the Postmaster General’s somewhat prolific,
if not always lucid, verbiage, to prove that he knows more about the
publication and distribution of publications than the most experienced
and successful periodical publishers have yet learned, however experienced
they are and however hard they have striven to familiarize
themselves with the many intricacies which the business involves.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOME PUBLIC-BUBBLING FIGURES.</span></h2>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock’s persistent activity in seeking to
push the “rider” through the Senate was a noticeable feature in the
closing hours of that session of Congress, his industry showing in
his daily contact on the floor of the Senate with the members who
seemed pliable or willing to harken to his wishes in the matter pertaining
to the legislation he wished to have made into law. The
following communications, adroit and carefully worded to Chairman
Penrose, boldly justified the increase on second-class matter, and may
be regarded as the dying struggle of the postoffice head to gain his
point.</p>

<p>The italics are the writer’s and set out the controversial promiscuousness
of the Postmaster General. The letters bear date February
14-15, 1911:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, February 14, 1911.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Senator</span>:&mdash;In response to your request I <i>submit the following
statement</i> relative to the section of the postal appropriation bill, H. R. 31539, now
pending in the Senate that provides for an increase in the postage rate on the
advertising portions of periodical publications mailed as second-class matter.</p>

<p>Under the provision in the bill the postage rate on the advertising pages of
magazines is increased from 1 cent to 4 cents a pound, <i>but this increase does not
apply to newspapers of any kind</i>, nor does it affect periodical publications mailing
less than 4,000 pounds each issue. By the terms of the provision the privilege
of carrying advertisements is for the first time extended to several classes of
periodical publications enumerated in the act of March 3, 1879, namely, the
periodical <i>publications of benevolent or fraternal organizations, of regularly incorporated
institutions of learning, of trade union organizations, and of professional,
literary, historical, and scientific societies, including state boards of health</i>.</p>

<p>As the advertising portions of magazines comprise on an average about a
<i>third</i> of their total weight the effect of an increase from 1 to 4 cents on the advertising
pages will be to advance the postage rate for second-class matter as a whole
about 1 cent, making the second-class rate 2 cents a pound instead of 1 cent, as at
present. In view of the fact that it costs the government about 9 cents a pound
to handle and transport this class of mail the proposed increase is an exceedingly
moderate one.</p>

<p>In a whole page newspaper advertisement printed on the 12th instant, signed
by 34 of the <i>principal magazine and periodical publications</i> of the country, it is
stated that the increased rate “will drive a majority of the popular magazines out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of existence, and with them the enormous volume of profitable first-class mail
their advertising creates.” <i>This charge is made in the face of the fact that some, if
not all, of the signers of the statement are realizing tremendous profits from the vast
amount of high-priced advertisements.</i></p>

<p>It has been found <i>on investigation</i> that one of the great periodical publications
signing this protest contained in 21 of its successive issues, from January 1, 1910,
to and including May 21, 1910, exclusive of cover pages, an average of 19,354 agate
lines of advertising matter, which, at the same rate, would make a total of 1,006,408
lines for the year.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1910, the publisher of this periodical increased the rate for
ordinary advertising in his publication from $5 to $6 an agate line. At the higher
rate the <i>gross value</i> of the ordinary advertising space for one year would amount
to $6,038,448. Increased rates charged for the inside and outside cover pages
would bring $650,000, making a total <i>gross value</i> of $6,688,448. Allowing a discount
of 15 per cent, or $1,003,267, there would remain as a <i>total net value</i> of the
advertising in this publication for a single year the <i>tremendous sum of $5,685,181</i>.
The additional income from advertising resulting from the increased rates would
amount in a year <i>to $957,107, which would be much more than sufficient to pay the
proposed higher postage rate of 4 cents a pound on the advertising pages of the publication
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910</i>. In other words, <i>the advance
in advertising rates for this periodical will not only meet the higher postage charges,
but will leave a surplus of increased revenue to swell the annual profits of the magazine</i>.</p>

<p>In a printed statement recently issued by the president of one of the leading
magazine-publishing companies of New York City, <i>the exceedingly profitable
nature of the magazine business was clearly set forth</i>. According to his statement
the profits of his own magazine for the <i>month of October, 1910, showed an increase
over the corresponding</i> month for 1909 of 100 per cent on advertisements and 151
per cent on <i>subscriptions, making a net annual profit for dividends and surplus,
based on a circulation of 500,000 copies monthly, of $348,980</i>. Regarding the
periodical-publishing business in general, the same gentleman says in his statement
that “magazine publishers receive <i>gross</i> incomes as high as $6,000,000 in a
single year. Dividends amounting approximately to $1,000,000 yearly have
been made.” Speaking of the publishers of some of the magazines joining in the
protest against the proposed legislation, he says that one of them, according to
his own statement, realizes a net profit of $1,000,000 annually; of another, the
principal owner of two great publications, that his gross income is more than
$6,000,000 annually, and that his net profits for the same period exceed $1,000,000;
of another, that his magazine yields more than 10 per cent on a capital of $10,000,000;
of another, that his net profits are $600,000; of another, that the value of
his advertising space alone is $1,500,000 a year; of another, that his advertising
receipts are $75,000 per month and his profits are from $600,000 to $800,000 per
year; of still another, that his publishing business represents a profit of 100 per
cent a year to its stockholders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Senator</span>:&mdash;On February 13, 1911, Everybody’s Magazine
published in the local newspapers a full page advertisement attacking the proposed
increase in second-class postage carried by the postal bill now pending in
the Senate. In their statement the publishers claimed to have a circulation of
650,000 copies per issue and asserted that “the postal measure now before
Congress increases the cost of handling Everybody’s Magazine $150,000 a year.”
They further stated that in view of the fact that the magazine makes “each year
for its stockholders about $100,000,” the proposed increase would “actually
exclude the magazine from the mails.”</p>

<p>The department’s figures for the calendar year 1910 show that Everybody’s
Magazine mailed at the New York City postoffice 2,898,372 pounds of its issues as
second-class matter, on which the postage at the cent-a-pound rate was $28,983.72.
As an average of one-half of the pages is devoted to advertising, the proposed
increase of 3 cents per pound on such matter would make the additional postage
$43,475.58 per annum instead of $150,000, as stated by the publishers of the
magazine.</p>

<p>Based on the publishers’ statement of 650,000 circulation, the gross income
of Everybody’s would be about $1,550,000 annually, divided as follows:</p>

<table summary="Breakdown of the income of Everybody’s Magazine">
  <tr>
    <td>200,000 subscriptions, at $1 (net)</td>
    <td class="right vb">$200,000</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right vb">Grand total</td>
    <td class="total">$1,550,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Since the publishers state that the magazine makes each year for its stockholders
only about $100,000, the approximate cost of publication reaches the
surprisingly high figure of $1,450,000. Using their own statement showing a
circulation of 650,000, it appears that Everybody’s issues 7,800,000 single copies
annually. If their total net profits are only $100,000, it is evident that it must
cost the publishers approximately 19 cents to place a copy of the magazine in the
hands of a reader who can secure it on the news stand for 15 cents.</p>

<p>Before your committee reported the bill providing for the increased rate on
second-class matter, the publishers of Everybody’s Magazine announced that on
and after March 6, 1911, their rates for ordinary advertising would be advanced
from $500 to $600 a page. On the extremely conservative estimate that the
magazine carries a monthly average of 150 advertising pages, this advance will
produce an additional income of $150,000 per annum. As the proposed increase
of postage during a like period will amount to approximately $43,500, it is evident
that out of the increase of revenue alone the magazine will be able to pay the
additional postage and still retain a considerable surplus for its stockholders.</p>

<p class="center">Yours, very truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Frank H. Hitchcock</span>,<br />
<i>Postmaster General</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Investigations recently made by the Postoffice Department show that
large numbers of periodical publications already entered as second-class matter
are in reality nothing more than trade catalogues, which, under the law, ought to
be treated as third-class matter and subjected to a postage charge of 8 cents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
pound, which is the rate for catalogues. By inserting a few pages of reading
matter, these publications succeeded in being classed as magazines and thus
secured admission at the cent-a-pound rate. Among publications of this kind is
one containing 140 pages, 99 per cent of which are devoted to advertisements;
another containing 562 pages, 97 per cent of which are devoted to advertisements;
another containing 238 pages, 93 per cent of which are devoted to advertisements;
and another containing 268 pages, 89 per cent of which are devoted to advertisements.
Almost the entire space in these publications is devoted to the carrying
of commercial advertisements, and this in defiance of the statute specifically
excluding from the second-class privileges “publications designed primarily for
advertising purposes.”</p>

<p>By the proposed law, magazines, in so far as they provide public information,
are left exactly on a par with newspapers and the smaller periodicals, for the
increase of rate of 3 cents a pound attaches only to such portions of the magazines
as are devoted to advertising purposes.</p>

<p>The stock argument of magazine publishers that the profit to the government
on first-class matter induced by the advertisements in their publications
offsets any loss incurred by reason of the low postage rate on second-class matter
is disproved by the fact that the government’s entire profit on first-class matter
is less than the total loss on second-class mail matter.</p>

<p>During the fiscal year 1910 over 800,000,000 pounds of second-class matter
were carried through the mails at a loss to the government of $62,000,000. The
profits on all other classes of mail matter were more than swallowed up by this
tremendous loss, leaving a postal deficit for the year of about $6,000,000. It is
estimated that the annual saving to the government through the proposed increase
in postage will amount to about $6,000,000, or enough to wipe out what
remains of the deficit.</p>

<p>Magazines have repeatedly increased their advertising rates as their circulation
has grown, but the postal charges for the handling and transportation of
these magazines have remained stationary for years, so that while this increased
circulation has swollen the profits of the publishers it has added correspondingly
to the loss sustained by the government. It is clearly inequitable that the public
in its general correspondence, the publishers of books and pamphlets, and the
senders of small merchandise should continue to be taxed to meet the deficit
caused by a subsidy enjoyed by the publishers of the large magazines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Senator</span>:&mdash;Observing that the periodical publishers in their
opposition to the pending provision increasing postage on second-class mail
matter frequently refer to the low rate of one-fourth cent per pound charged by
the Dominion of Canada on newspapers and periodicals, I think it well to point
out the fact that while this exceptionally low rate does prevail in that country
because of the peculiar conditions there, European countries, so far as our information
goes, charge a higher rate than the United States, notwithstanding their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock in his letter, submitted under date
of February 14, 1911, quotes some publisher (name not mentioned),
as saying that “magazine publishers receive <i>gross</i> incomes as high as
$6,000,000 in a single year” … “that one of them, according
to his own statement, realizes a net profit of $1,000,000 annually”
… another, “the principal owner of two great magazines, says
that his <i>gross</i> income is more than $6,000,000 a year;” of another “that
his magazine yields more than 10% profit on a capitalization of
$10,000,000,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Beyond stating that the foregoing declarations were made by the
“President of one of the leading magazine publishing companies of
New York city,” Mr. Hitchcock sayeth not, save as he quotes (see
seventh paragraph of the Hitchcock letter), this President as saying
what Mr. Hitchcock says he said. The Postmaster General does not
name this “President.”</p>

<p>Regretting this oversight of our Postmaster General very much,
I would like to know whether or not this “President” is the real,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
genuine article of president, or is merely one of these “phoney”
presidents who laboriously support the honors of the corporate title
and vote three shares of stock, usually <i>given</i> by the promoters of an
organization for the “influence” of an honored name in starting the
wheels to revolve.</p>

<p>I mean by this that it would be <i>information</i> to thousands of Mr.
Hitchcock’s readers, as well as to thousands of publishers and
printers, <i>and numerous millions of American citizens</i>, had he, Mr.
Hitchcock, told them whether this “President” he quotes so liberally,
likewise confidently and confidingly, is a real, live-wire president,
active in the management of his periodical, and, therefore, fully
informed as to its business, expenditures, profits, etc., etc., or, on the
other hand, whether or not he is merely a corporation stool-bird for
the promotion of a publication enterprise through selling the stock of
the concern to the E. Z.-Mark investing public.</p>

<p>The quotations which our Postmaster General makes from this
publisher “President” sound to me with quite a familiar <i>tang</i>. They
read a good bit like a promotion circular, like an “annual statement”
which corporations and companies as well as individuals print and
distribute to call attention to the prosperous <i>future</i> they have in sight,
incidentally inviting <i>investment</i> from savings banks accounts, stocking
hoardings, etc.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong about that method of “public bubbling” at all.
Even banking institutions, national and state, sometimes resort to it.
Occasionally, commercial houses have used it. So, also, has the Steel
Corporation, when it wished its employes to chip in a few millions for
“a personal interest.” Our friend, “Bet-You-a-Million-Gates,” used
it to advantage in reorganizing the Louisville and Nashville system,
and it is a practice now and again indulged in among our Napoleons
of finance, as well as great captains in the industrial realm.</p>

<p>For this reason I cannot&mdash;until our Postmaster General further
enlightens us regarding this publisher-president as to his personality,
individuality and general business activity in and knowledge of,
his own publication business,&mdash;say anything in adverse criticism of
this “President” Mr Hitchcock quotes so liberally, likewise
unctuously.</p>

<p>However, having been a periodical publisher myself, in a small
way, I shall presume here to present a few figures <i>approximately</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
applicable to larger periodical enterprises. Mr. Hitchcock has much
to say about <i>gross</i> receipts, <i>gross</i> revenues, and other <i>gross</i>. I shall
present my estimate of <i>net profits</i>. For this purpose, I shall take a
monthly periodical reputedly issuing 650,000 copies a month, each
number weighing about one pound.</p>

<p>Now, let it be here distinctly understood by the reader that my
figures, mostly estimates, are those of a man with experience only as
a small periodical publisher, say of 50,000 a month, not 650,000.</p>

<p>Estimated income of the publisher of a standard monthly
periodical distributing 650,000 copies monthly of average weight of
one pound each, Mr. Hitchcock figures to be (see his letter), about
$6,000,000. The gross annual receipts from subscriptions on a periodical
issuing 650,000 copies per month, and retailing at 15 cents per
copy, is less than $750,000. Such periodicals realize about 12½ cents
each for subscribed copies and 8 cents net for copies delivered in bulk
to newsdealers and agencies. The first item of expense the publisher
incurs, therefore, is in the issue cost of production over what he receives
for the copies issued. It is knowledge common to every periodical
publisher, newspaper as well as magazine, that every subscriber
as well as news-stand buyer of his periodical is a <i>subsidized reader</i>. Do
you catch the import of that statement?</p>

<p>Did you ever think of that, Mr. Reader? Frankly I confess that
I did not, until quite recently, when a large producer of trade journals
and edition books, and likewise one of our largest manufacturing
printers, pointed out the facts to me. His varied business
interests are such that he must necessarily buy at the lowest market
cost, must know to the fraction of a cent what those costs are&mdash;the
cost of composition, of presswork, of ink, of color work, of covers, of
binding, of cartage, of rail haulage, of distribution, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Well, this gentleman summoned me off the ladder, and “called”
me in a way which made my landing somewhat abrupt, in order to tell
me some things about periodical publishing which he had shrewdly,
likewise correctly, guessed that I did not know.</p>

<p>Among the things he told me, not only told me but proved to
me, was the one stated: that readers of periodicals get, <i>in net
mechanical cost, more than the publishers receive for the publication sold</i>.</p>

<p>In proof of this he cited the 8-page dailies issued in cities of the
second and third classes, and the 16 to 32-page dailies published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our metropolitan cities; also the great “Sunday Editions” issued by
the latter, issues which run more largely to color and <i>tonnage</i> than to
news and literature. The former, (the dailies), my publisher friend
pointed out, realize about <i>six-tenths of one cent a copy</i>&mdash;a little less,
if they do cartage for any considerable part of their local deliveries
or pay rail haulage charges on outside deliveries. Of course, my tutor
is speaking of news agents and carrier deliveries. On their regular
subscribed issues publishers realize a little more. But the difference,
when cost of wrapping and addressing is figured, is so
trifling as not to be worth considering. It can be safely figured that
the net price received by the publisher of a newspaper is six-tenths of
one cent for the daily and about three and a half cents&mdash;probably
nearer three cents&mdash;for the leviathan metropolitan Sunday edition.</p>

<p>Just here is where my publisher friend’s knowledge of <i>market
costs</i> came forth for my enlightenment and, I sincerely hope, for my
reader’s as well. Having studied his business from the “stumpage”
up, so to speak, he began with the cost of pulp wood timber, “of
stumpage,” from the spruce forests of the north and farther north, the
scattered linn or basswood of the east and southeast, and of the soft
maple and cottonwood of the southeast and south. Then he told me
of the prices paid the “lumber jacks” to fell and saw this pulp-wood; of
the cost of hauling it by ox, mule or horsepower to the river “roll-way,”
which river would carry it down to the pulp mill, or hauling it to
the railroad loading station for rail carriage to the same point.</p>

<p>Nor did he do that only. He told me the price of the “web press
roll” and of “flat-print” papers into which the wood pulp is made,
paper stock on which is printed all our periodicals&mdash;both newspapers
and monthly and weekly periodicals. Next he told me of the price
of composition, (typesetting, as we used to call it), by the most
modern methods, the linotype and the monotype machines. Then
he talked of ink and presswork costs, of color work, folding, stitching
and covering or binding; of the cost of wrapping, addressing, cartage,
rail haulage and distribution. The result of the expert’s showing of
the <i>cost</i> of raw material and of skilled and other labor in periodical
publication, as the periodicals are printed and marketed today, was to
the effect that the reader gets his daily, weekly or monthly publication,
on an average, <i>at less than half what it costs the publisher to
produce it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, it was conclusively shown to me, that the publisher’s
<i>net</i> receipts for a newspaper, magazine or other periodical is often but
a third, sometimes less than <i>a fourth</i>, of the net cost to him of its production
and distribution.</p>

<p>With this preliminary, we will now go back to our magazine of
650,000 monthly issue and Postmaster General Hitchcock’s estimate
of its profits.</p>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock’s talk of “gross” receipts of
$6,000,000 a year is ill advised. Let us see what must be charged off
from that $6,000,000 before the publisher can count his profits.</p>

<p>First, we will figure the publisher’s loss on published copies.
Taking only the flat cost of paper, ink and composition; of the cost
of fine color and half-tone pages such as monthly periodicals must
print; of cover designing, presswork, and binding, of wrapping and
addressing, say 150,000 copies of the monthly issue to individual
addresses, that being, approximately at least, the number of subscribed
readers the publisher will have on a total issue of 650,000 copies.
Next comes the cost of sacking his subscribed circulation and of
bundling and wrapping, then of cartage to mail trains. The prominent
periodical publisher not only delivers his subscribed list <i>sacked</i>
to the mail car, but he <i>routes</i> the larger portion of it, the railway mail
clerks having nothing to do with it save to dump it off at the designated
stations. Then he must meet the carriage and delivery cost, about
1 cent a pound, or $20.00 a ton. All these I consider <i>flat</i> costs of
producing and delivering the publication. To this flat cost must be
added the expenditures for contributing writers, for editors, proofreaders
and special investigators (including travel and other expenses),
stenographers, postage and stationery for a large correspondence,
clerical, messenger and other administration service, rents, insurance,
etc., etc. And, finally, the expenditures made in the way of commissions
and premiums to work up a subscribed issue.</p>

<p>A monthly periodical of the size and character which Postmaster
General Hitchcock has reference to&mdash;of the size and character
to win its way to an issue of 650,000 copies a month&mdash;must cost its
publisher not less, on an average, than 30 cents per copy, probably
more. The subscribing reader pays 12½ cents per copy for it&mdash;pays
directly to the publisher. The news stand buyer pays 15 cents a
copy, but the publisher, after paying newsdealer and agency commissions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
on the latter sales, realizes but <i>8 cents per copy</i>. Here let
us see how this publisher’s circulation-cost and receipts figure out.
Six hundred and fifty thousand monthly issue figures to an issue of
7,800,000 copies for the year. At 30 cents’ cost of production, which
is rather low than high, those copies cost the publisher to produce, to
get readers for and to distribute, the annual total of $2,340,000.
He realizes in return from subscription and news stand sales about
as follows:</p>

<table summary="The publisher’s receipts">
  <tr>
    <td>From news stand and agency sales (500,000 per month, or 6,600,000
        copies a year), he realizes 8 cents per copy or</td>
    <td class="right vb">$480,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From subscribers (150,000 per month or 1,800,000 a year), at 12½ cents each</td>
    <td class="right vb">225,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">Total receipts</td>
    <td class="total">$705,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Thus it is clear that for an expenditure of $2,340,000 a year to
produce and distribute his excellent <i>low-priced</i> periodical to readers,
the publisher gets in return only $705,000, thus standing a net loss
of $1,635,000 on his mechanical output&mdash;no, on his <i>literary and
educational output</i>. And, mark you, that $705,000 Mr. Hitchcock
must, necessarily, have included in his “gross” receipts. How, then,
is the publisher able to furnish his readers such literary and educational
nourishment at so great a loss on production?</p>

<p>There is but one answer: The advertising carried by the periodical
must recoup the loss on publication and yield the publisher whatever
profit he may realize. Yet Mr. Hitchcock, in the profound
profundity of his knowledge of periodical publishing, figures that the
advertising receipts are clear profit to the publisher. True, he does,
in one of his urgent letters to Senator Penrose, I believe it is, incidentally
admit a possible maximum cost or expense of “fifteen per cent”
in securing and printing the advertisements. “Fifteen per cent!”</p>

<p>Omitting all undigestible words, I shall merely say that Mr.
Hitchcock’s fifteen per cent talk&mdash;about the cost of soliciting and
printing advertising matter by any of our high-class periodicals, shows
a knowledge of the subject nearly on the level of that of a cold-storage
egg.</p>

<p>Why, fifteen per cent of the gross receipts for advertising by
any of our high-class periodicals scarcely would meet&mdash;I doubt if
in any such case it does <i>meet</i>&mdash;the expenditures made for skilled “layout”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
men and designers. Everyone knows that the advertising
pages of any of our standard weekly and monthly periodicals are <i>art
pages</i>. People <i>read</i> the “ads” in these periodicals. They are largely
attracted to them by their artistic arrangement, typographically and
in design. It takes <i>brains</i> to make that arrangement, brains of finer
fiber or better trained than the cold storage variety. The service of
such brains <i>costs money</i>. Who pays it? <i>The publisher.</i> And the
publisher who gets the services of such brains at less than fifteen per
cent of the “gross” charge for his advertising must, in these days, be
a wonder in business acumen or a “pow’ful ’suadin’ boss,” as Rastus
used to say, down on the Yazoo, years ago, when he took a job at
twenty-five cents a day less than he had asked.</p>

<p>I say the people <i>read</i> these “ads” and, fearing I shall forget it
later, I desire to interpolate here another thought: They are led to
read them because of the artistic letterpress, the designing, the
attractive phrasing, catchy wording, etc. They read them. <i>You</i>
and <i>I</i> read them. And&mdash;well, that is my point&mdash;my thought.</p>

<p>The “ads” in periodicals of the class of which we are speaking
cover almost every field and domain of life&mdash;of human life&mdash;of <i>our</i>
lives. They tell us of the latest inventions and achievements in the
mechanical and industrial world; of the latest improvements in the
cultivation of the land; of the latest and best in “hen range” management
and “run-way” poultry raising; of the latest achievements of
Luther Burbank, or some other wizard in the domain of pomology;
of kitchen and flower gardening; of how to cut down our gas bills;
to make the ton of coal deliver more “duty”&mdash;more thermic B. T.
U.’s&mdash;of the best new books and of bargain reprint editions of the
best old ones; of where to get a cheap home, cheap acres around it
and how to build and furnish a comfortable home cheaply; in fact,
of an infinity of daily and hourly needs. So what is the use of my
enumerating further? Every reader knows what those “ads” in our
standard periodicals do for us. They enlighten, they inform, they
<i>educate</i> us. And that is why we read them, and that is why we
should continue to do so.</p>

<p>We will get back now to Mr. Hitchcock and his “wondrous
ways” of figuring a publisher’s profits on the advertising he prints.
Postmaster General Hitchcock appears to have ignored the fact I
have already pointed out&mdash;ignored the fact that the publisher’s heaviest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
loss is on the printing and distribution end of his periodical, and
thus is a charge against his advertising receipts.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock, so far as I have been able to read him, furthermore
ignores the important fact that advertisements are secured for
a periodical largely by solicitation. Of course, the “Want,” “To
Rent,” “For Sale” and similar small line “ads” come to newspapers
largely without personal solicitation. But the display advertiser
does not frantically rush to the publisher and say: “Here’s my
check for $500.00. Give me a page display for this line of goods.”
Not at all. The publisher must go after him and, not infrequently,
go after him numerous times before he lands his $500.00 or $5,000.00
contract or order. To secure such advertisements the publisher employs
the most skilled advertising solicitors within reach of his bank
balance. Such men, if carried on his regular payroll, are among the
“high-salaried” human units which make up the operating, managing
and service personnel of his business. If they are not on regular
salary the publisher must pay such men a liberal commission on the
contracts secured, a commission seldom or never as low as 10 per cent
and I have known them to range as high as 40 or 50 per cent of the
gross price received on the first or initial contract, “just to show the
advertiser what we can do for him,” as the publisher frequently
reasons.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY UNDER OATH.</h3>

<p>Senate Document No. 820 presents a reply by some publishers to
Mr. Hitchcock’s loose or reckless statements on the point under consideration.
I wish to appropriate for use here some very manifestly
truthful statements made in that Senate Document No. 820. I shall
summarize or quote as best fits my line of presentation.</p>

<p>In 1909 the publishers of five standard magazines, admittedly
carrying “the largest amount of advertising” among the monthly
periodicals, made <i>a sworn statement</i> covering their receipts, expenditures
and net profits. That sworn statement is on file in the Department
of Commerce and Labor and is easily accessible to the Postmaster
General if he desires to know a little something of what <i>the
publishers know about their own business</i>. The publishers of the five
periodicals thus making sworn statements to the government of their
incomes, expenditures and profits, are the publishers of “Everybody’s,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
“McClure’s”, “The Review of Reviews,” “The Cosmopolitan” and
“The American.”</p>

<p>The named periodicals, it will be at once recognized, if not
the strongest, at least are among the strongest monthly periodicals of
this country. Yet these sworn statements show that Mr. Hitchcock’s
proposed increase of 3 cents a pound in their mailing rates would,
under present conditions, <i>exhaust “81.8 percent of their net profits</i>.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Hitchcock’s proposal, prompted, it would appear, by
ulterior motives, as was recently evidenced by his <i>voluminous</i> buttonholing
of interested or “interests” Senators and Congressmen to put
his “rider” over&mdash;no, maybe it is not really his, but <i>it looks like him</i>&mdash;for
an increase on second-class matter would, if made operative,
would so seriously impair the financial strength of five such <i>strong</i>
periodicals as those named, what, it is the part both of duty and of
honesty to ask, will become of the <i>scores</i> of smaller periodicals, especially
of those periodicals which issue more than “two tons” at a
mailing and which serve, inform and <i>educate</i> a reading patronage that
needs them?</p>

<p>If Mr. Hitchcock’s actions in this matter are clean and open&mdash;not
“influenced”&mdash;he might not only serve himself but a good and worthy
cause as well, if he would give some pointers to these smaller publishers&mdash;those
between his “4,000 pounds an issue” exemptions from his
four-cent rate and the stronger periodical publications, five of which
are before him in sworn statement. If he would give, I say, these
middle-class publishers&mdash;we may so call them for the comparison in
hand, though their published matter is of the <i>highest class</i> all the time&mdash;if
he would give such publishers some method or scheme to keep from
the financial rocks, they, I am quite sure, would greatly appreciate it.
Possibly they would put him on their free lists in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock appears to be a phenomenon at “figurin’” and for
the devising of methods to obliterate postoffice “deficits;” also at
following the ulterior motive and its “influence,” and still provide,
by exemptions or otherwise, to protect the “fence-building” country
newspapers,&mdash;indeed newspapers in general, now that I read him
again. Likewise he protects the farm, the religious, the scientific, the
mechanical and other publications whose influence, it appears, does
not <i>obstructively</i> influence the “influences” which have directed his
recent action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know who wrote that Senate Document No. 820.
Whoever it was, he certainly knew “a gob of things,” as our splendid
friend, the washerwoman, would put it, about the United States
Postoffice Department, its management and its methods. I shall
probably “crib” or plagiarize several times from this Senate Document
No. 820, but just here I desire to quote a paragraph from it:</p>

<p>“Postmaster General Hitchcock’s profound ignorance concerning
the relation of magazine advertising to magazine profits is shown by
the fact that although these magazines received in 1909, $2,463,940.39
for advertising, the aggregate of their net incomes was only $230,734.57,&mdash;less
than one-tenth of their advertising receipts.”</p>

<p>This Document No. 820 is all good, so good that I believe I will
reprint from it further and at this point:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock proceeds in the first and second paragraphs
on page four to cite a recent increase of advertising rates of a certain magazine,
and to consider, and use in figuring, as net profits the <i>total amount of advertising
it carries for the year</i>.</p>

<p>(It is of incidental interest, in showing the <i>partisan attitude</i> of the Postmaster
General, that in calculating the total amount of advertising received by this
publication, he takes the number of lines actually printed in this weekly’s
<i>richest advertising season</i>, ignoring the fact that in the summer this periodical is
sometimes published at a loss, and makes an estimate of its advertising patronage
for the whole year on the basis of what it received in the months when advertising
is at its height).</p>

<p>But the gigantic error of the Postmaster General is in calculating the additional
income from advertising for this weekly resulting from its increased advertising
rate, and assuming that this increased income is all profit. This error arises from
the Postmaster General’s <i>total ignorance</i> of the publishing business in general; and
in particular, of the fact proved above, that the magazines save only a small fraction
of their aggregate advertising income as net profits after paying the expenses
of production and administration.</p>

<p>Then the Postmaster General finds out how much money the increased rate
brought the periodical and observes with an air of finality that this income was
more than sufficient to meet the higher postal charges.</p>

<p>The facts are, of course, that to get this higher advertising rate, the “great
periodical” had to publish enough more copies and additional reading matter in
those copies to justify the increased rate; and that to manufacture and supply
these additional subscriptions it costs magazines more than twice as much as they
get from subscribers. Furthermore, the Postmaster General takes gross advertising
income as net profit, apparently thinking that advertising flows into periodical
offices without the asking, where, as a matter of fact, it is necessary to spend
enormous sums for high-priced men to solicit advertising, for other men to lay out
plans and make designs for advertisers, and for a large clerical force to handle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the advertising department. The calm way in which the Postmaster General
ignores the cost of presswork and paper on which the advertising is printed, exhibits
his ignorance of the fact that there is in business an expense side of the
ledger as well as an income side.</p>

<p>If a magazine has 100,000 circulation and a fair corresponding rate for
advertising and if the circulation is then increased to 200,000, the publisher has
the same right and the same necessity to charge more for the doubled circulation
that a grocer has to charge more for two pounds of tea than for one pound. But
what possible relation has this to the fact that postage rates have remained stationary?
<i>The postoffice gives no more service than it did before magazine circulations
and advertising increased</i>&mdash;in fact it gives less, as it now requires the big magazines
to separate and tag for distribution, and, in many cases, deliver to the trains,
<i>a vast quantity of magazine mail, formerly handled entirely by the postoffice</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>I wonder if Mr. Hitchcock ever read “Job Jobson, Nos. 1, 2 and
3.” If he has not there is something due him which he ought to
take immediate steps to collect. “Job Jobson” in three little pamphlets
tells <i>more</i> than either Mr. Hitchcock or myself will ever be able
to learn about second-class mail carriage and handling&mdash;unless, of
course, we read those three booklets of Job Jobson.</p>

<p>Why are Job Jobson’s three booklets so important? A very
pertinent question, indeed, at this stage of our consideration. Job
Jobson’s three booklets are toweringly important inasmuch as they
were written by Wilmer Atkinson, publisher of the Farm Journal of
Philadelphia, one of the most successful as well as the most <i>useful</i>
farm periodicals the world has ever produced.</p>

<p>More than that, Mr. Atkinson has so long and so thoroughly
studied this second-class mail rate question that both Mr. Hitchcock
and myself would have to take our places in the kindergarten class
where he is tutor.</p>

<p>I haven’t those three “Job Jobson’s” by me. I have thumbed
two of them out of existence, but from the one I have I desire to
quote a couple of paragraphs which I hope it will do Mr. Hitchcock
as much good to read as it does me to re-read. Here they are in all
their vigor:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Publishers, one and all, should take their stand upon the immutable principle
that newspaper circulation is not a crime, and it is not a fault, that neither a
law on the statute books, much less arbitrary power outside the law, should
ever be invoked to curtail the liberty and independence of the press, which are a
sacred inheritance from the fathers; or to cripple newspaper enterprises or
bankrupt those engaged in this noble calling.</p>

<p>That to send their papers into the very confines of the republic, into every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
home, however rich, however humble, to brighten and to bless, is a great and
beneficent work, worthy of all praise and all honor&mdash;worthy of the nurturing
care, rather than the antagonism of government.</p>

</div>

<p>And that was written only a few years ago&mdash;written <i>true to the
facts</i>. I desire here to quote a couple more paragraphs. They have
been published generally throughout the country and universally
indorsed. They are written by the Hon. Woodrow Wilson, Governor
of New Jersey:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A tax upon the business of the more widely circulated magazines and
periodicals would be a tax upon their means of living and performing their functions.
They obtain their circulation by their direct appeal to the popular thought.
Their circulation attracts advertisers. Their advertisements enable them to pay
their writers and to enlarge their enterprise and influence.</p>

<p>This proposed new postal rate would be a direct tax, and a very serious one,
upon the formation and expression of opinion&mdash;its most deliberate formation and
expression&mdash;just at a time when opinion is concerning itself most actively and
effectively with the deepest problems of our politics and our social life. To make
such a change, whatever its intentions in the minds of those who proposed it,
would be to attack and embarrass the free processes of opinion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">BUREAUCRATIC POWERS SOUGHT.</span></h2>

<p>I have before me the Postmaster General’s report for 1910. It
presents a large amount of information both in statistical tabulation
and in “straight matter.” A portion of the former, however, leaves
the average lay mind rambling around in circles, wondering what in
the name of all that is lofty it was compiled for, what service value it
can possibly have and what was the ailment from which the fellow
who compiled it suffered; that is, was his a case merely of bad liver
or indigestion, or a serious case of ingrown intellect, struggling to help
his fellowmen know how real dizzy and foolish tabulated figures can
be made to appear?</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock in this 1910 report has separated himself from
some striking oddities, about as serviceably valuable as a smoking
compartment would be to a laundry wagon. Of course, it may be
that Mr. Hitchcock did not write the division of this report signed by
him. Some talented secretary, clerk or assistant may have cranked it
up. However that may be, do not let what I here say deter you from
looking through this 1910 report should it come your way. It contains
a variety of excellent things, some valuable information, well
collated and intelligibly presented. The foolishness and fooleries in it
are&mdash;well, they are of the kind common to all, or at least most, departmental
reports, federal, state, county and city. Much of the tabulated
“statistics” in each can have no possible service value either in
this world or the next&mdash;even assuming that statistics and statisticians
will be recognized at all in that division of the “next” to which
we all aspire.</p>

<p>As to the “straight matter” in these departmental reports, one
often finds in it some most excellent suggestions, as is certainly the
case with Mr. Hitchcock’s 1910 production. One also finds a lot of
other suggestions and space-written stuff that would make a totem
laugh&mdash;that is, of course, presuming a totem could laugh and had
advanced as far as the third grammar school grade in reading.</p>

<p>And the “literary style” of these official reports; so aerial in
elevation, so officially dignified in “tone,” so profusely profound or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
profoundly profuse in elaboration and detail, and often so <i>trivial</i> in
significance or import!</p>

<p>If they were still with us, the “literary” standard of most of these
departmental reports would make Bertha M. Clay hug the rail and
E. P. Roe carry weight. But, of course, one must not look for nor
expect literary exaltedness in a departmental report. It should,
however, tell us&mdash;<i>we people</i>&mdash;a good many things we wish to know,
in fact, <i>ought</i> to know. It should not give us too much talk merely
to show us how much&mdash;or how little&mdash;some chief or assistant knows.
If you get the opportunity, read the Postmaster General’s 1910 report,
and you will find many things in it that will jar you loose from your
expectations, but do not be alarmed at that. Just keep in mind the
fact that you can come as near reciting the Rubaiyat backwards as
can Postmaster General Hitchcock, and that you at least know Old
Mother Hubbard “by heart” as well as he knows it.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make&mdash;to emphasize&mdash;is that Mr.
Hitchcock’s 1910 report presents much valuable information for you
and me. So you should not allow its follies to scare you off. For
instance, the Postmaster General’s fifty notations of “Improvements
in Organization and Methods.” Why he should stop at a round
fifty I do not know. I believe he could easily have added twenty or
thirty more <i>of kind</i>. Some of these “improvements” are most
excellent; some of them are so assumedly conclusive on matters
previously&mdash;for years&mdash;in doubt and controversy as to touch off the
risibles in any man who has made anything like a careful study of
conditions governing the Postoffice Department. For instance, his
“Improvement” numbered 10 reads:</p>

<p>“The successful completion of an <i>inquiry</i> into the cost of handling
and transporting mail of the several classes and of conducting the
money order, registry and special delivery services.”</p>

<p>We can <i>hope</i> that the aforesaid “inquiry” was so carefully and
comprehensively conducted as to entitle it to be classed as “successful”
as Mr. Hitchcock’s statement is assertive. However, just how
far we may prudently indulge such hope is a matter for grave consideration.
The Postmaster General’s Third Assistant, James J.
Britt, attempts to tell us (pp. 328-329, 1910 report), all about it.
Mr. Britt will be referred to later.</p>

<p>Again: Mr. Hitchcock in his No. 11 “Improvement,” reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
“the successful prosecution of an inquiry into the cost <i>to the railroad
companies</i> of carrying the mails, the result of which will form
a <i>reliable basis</i> for fixing rates of pay for railroad mail transportation.”</p>

<p>Now, if Mr. Hitchcock has really and truly so conducted an
“inquiry” as to ascertain a “<i>reliable basis</i>” of pay for the mail haulage
service rendered by the railroads&mdash;“a reliable basis” that can be
built upon, acted upon and <i>enforced</i>&mdash;if he has done that, then he
deserves a niche in the Hall of Fame. But here, again, I am
doubtful. Did you take Britt’s word for it, Mr. Hitchcock, or did
you steer the “inquiry” yourself? The only point of interest to us
of the commonalty involved in your eleventh improvement is: Can
you, or any other Postmaster General, compel or persuade the
railroads to carry the mail at a reasonable rate? Will such rate be
based upon that “reliable basis” you say you have ascertained?</p>

<p>Grant us but that and we shall ask no more nor will you have
any “deficits” to worry about. I know you explain quite fully
(pp. 18-20), as to how you went about it, how Congress made appropriation
for a force of “temporary clerks” to tabulate the information,
the data which your “successful” inquiry brought to the surface.
Still, knowing something about the <i>devious</i> peculiarities of the railways
in the past&mdash;say, back to the Wolcott investigation (at this
moment I forget the year when this was made and have neither the
time nor the opportunity to climb down and look it up)&mdash;unless the
railways have had a rush of honesty and conscience into their reports,
accounts and <i>practices</i>, I am gravely <i>doubtful</i> as to the dependability
of the data your “inquiry” uncovered. Of course, if you went after
them, backed by a court order calling for a showdown, Mr. Hitchcock,
you may have arrived somewhere in the vicinity of the facts. Otherwise&mdash;well,
you got about what other <i>inquirers</i> got&mdash;<i>got what the
railways wanted you to know</i>.</p>

<p>I shall make no further specific reference to the fifty improvements
the Postmaster General claims to have covered into operative
effectiveness. It is due, however, that I say, in this connection, that
the majority of those named in the report are sound, sane and <i>serviceably</i>
economic. It is also due from me to say that I personally know
that Mr. Hitchcock has already made a number of them effectively
operative in his department and to the betterment of its service. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
contention with the Postmaster General is chiefly concerning three
points, viz.:</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;His manifest intent to throw the burden of his departmental
deficit upon a few <i>independent</i> periodicals which, by reason of
their independence, have indulged the proclivity or practice of
<i>telling the truth about corporate, vested and other favored interests, and
about corrupt officials&mdash;city, county, state, national, executive, legislative
and juridic</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;His colossally unjust and unfair way of figuring his
“deficit” against such periodicals. Maybe it was Britt, Third Assistant
Postmaster General, or some other “pied” subordinate who did
the figuring. I do not know. However, in common with other
citizens, I hold Mr. Hitchcock responsible for those figures, as we are
fully warranted in doing by reason of his official position.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>&mdash;Mr. Hitchcock, it appears, in his reports and letters,
gives us a lot of talk that is <i>twisted</i>, “pretzel talk,” someone has aptly
called it. This “night-crawler” talk quite naturally&mdash;legitimately,
if not naturally&mdash;leaves thoughtful people to wonder what he wants,
<i>what he is after</i>, what interest or interests he is trying to subserve and
what “influences” have <i>influenced</i> him to go after certain periodicals
in so <i>bald and crude a way</i>.</p>

<p>Still, that does not altogether fully express my third objection
to Mr. Hitchcock and his methods. His letters and special reports in
support of the absurd claim that the transportation and handling of
second-class mail matter costs 9.23 cents per pound, a figure above or
equal to that which will carry gold or currency bills <i>by express</i> for the
average mail haul, furnish valid grounds for doubt as to the good
faith of his intent, to suspicion an <i>ulterior motive</i> back of his action
and writings. To this I do not hesitate to say that his 1910 report, I
mean his own personally signed section of it, is offensively <i>bureaucratic</i>.
Mr. Hitchcock, it appears from his own recommendations,
would have his bureau or department bigger than Congress. He
wants powers and authority centered in it which Congress <i>should
not delegate, which Congress has no rightful powers nor authority to
delegate</i>.</p>

<p>Now, do not misapprehend me. Maybe Mr. Hitchcock has not
done all this on his own initiative. He may have acted wholly on a
long-distance or a central direction from the main stem. I shall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
however, proceed to support my accusation that Mr. Hitchcock
evidences in his 1910 report a desire&mdash;a tendency, if not a desire,&mdash;to
make the Postmaster General not only a censor of periodical literature
(as indicated in the wording of that “rider” amendment printed on a
previous page), but to have delegated to him powers over the mail
service which not only contravene the basic principles of a democratic
form of government, but which, also, tend to establish a bureaucracy
that, if carried to its full flower, will, necessarily <i>abrogate our form of
government itself</i>.</p>

<p>Here let us note Mr. Hitchcock’s recommended legislation. In
the report before me he makes thirty-six recommendations. In each
of these which grants added powers or authority touching any matter,
the wording of the suggested legislation gives such added powers and
authority to the <i>Postmaster General</i>. In certain minor matters,
especially such as relate only to departmental methods of handling its
service accounts, etc., such grant of power is entirely proper. Among
Mr. Hitchcock’s recommendations are several of such character, and,
so far as I have studied them, they appear sound, and consequently
their passage by Congress and their application to the department
would, in my judgment, effect material savings or betterments in the
service.</p>

<p>In a number of other instances, however, Mr. Hitchcock asks
legislation that will grant him (or any succeeding head of the federal
Postoffice Department), powers and authority which <i>should be
granted to no bureau or departmental division of our government service</i>.
I mean that the acquirement of such legislative powers and authority
by bureaus (cabinet service divisions), is inimical to the basic
principles of our government; in fact, it is a <i>stealthy</i> move to establish
in this country the bureaucratic form of government which has proved a
curse in every existing monarchical government, causing their peoples
to rebel against them, or constantly a condition of unrest under
the system&mdash;a condition which indicates either <i>enforced</i> submission
to governmental wrongs and impositions or a dwarfed and submerged
manhood, “begging for leave to live” and devoting most of its thought
to a few questions, such as: “Why did I arrive? What am I here for?
I work, why does the government take most of my earnings? Why
does the government and its bureau heads live, live in luxury, while
I and my wife and children merely exist,&mdash;barely subsist? <i>Why are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hundreds of millions taken every year from people who need it to secure
the common comforts of life, and given, unearned, to those who need it
not at all?</i>”</p>

<p>It would require pages even to print the inquiries which the
victims of bureaucratic governments ask themselves daily, ask themselves
daily so long as they <i>exist above the level of the clod</i>, above the
level which Edward Markham so forcefully and eloquently depicts in
his “Man with the Hoe.”</p>

<p>The point I desire to emphasize is that when the great body of
people in any country&mdash;its “citizens”&mdash;begin to ask themselves such
questions, <i>their patriotism begins to dry-rot and die</i>, and when the
patriotism of a nation’s people begins to die, that nation is on the
farther slope of its existence; it has started on the decline, more or
less sharp, <i>which ends in rebellion</i>, dissolution, extinction. This is the
uniform lesson of history. He who reads it not so reads either not
carefully or not comprehendingly.</p>

<p>To a few of my readers the foregoing may appear to be a digression
from my subject. It is not intended as such. It is intended to
call the reader’s attention to some powers and authority Mr. Hitchcock
seeks in his recommended legislation, <i>legislation which should
not be enacted</i>. Let us look at a few of those recommendations. If
space permitted, I would take pleasure in commenting on several
more of them.</p>

<p>On page 10 of his report, Mr. Hitchcock repeats a recommendation
of his 1909 report. He repeats it “earnestly.” He also expresses
the opinion that “<i>as soon as the postal savings system is thoroughly
organized</i>, the Postoffice Department should be prepared to establish
throughout the country a general parcels post.” As a “preliminary
step” to such establishment of a parcels post Mr. Hitchcock seeks
authority from Congress to initiate a “limited parcels post service on
rural routes.” On page 26 of his report, Mr. Hitchcock suggests the
<i>substantials</i> of the legislation he believes necessary to enable him to
establish his contemplated “limited parcels post service on rural
routes,” <i>as an experimental test</i>.</p>

<p>As evidence that he wants the power and authority to make this
“experiment” on his own lines and judgment and pursuant of his <i>own
purposes</i> I shall here quote the form of his advised legislation. To
anyone who has made study of parcels post service it is needless to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
that among the civilized nations of the earth the United States is so
far in arrears in such service as to be generally recognized as an
international joke. It is quite needless to say to such that Mr.
Hitchcock’s prattle of a “limited” parcels post and of trying it on
certain <i>selected</i> rural routes (with no privileges of service beyond the
geographical limits of such routes), as an “experiment,” is more than
a mere joke.</p>

<p>Informed people know that any such restricted test of a parcels
post service <i>is no test at all</i>. Informed men also know that our Federal
Postoffice Department needs make no “experiments” on the parcels
post service, “limited” or other. Every other civilized nation, and
even provinces such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others,
have made the “experiments,” likewise the successful demonstrations.
The experiments of these other nations and provinces, as well as the
results of them, are ours for the asking. Not alone that, but informed
men <i>know, and know positively</i>, that our Federal Postoffice Department
is in possession of&mdash;<i>or was in possession of</i>&mdash;all this information gathered
from the experiences and trials and tests of a parcels post service
in these other countries.</p>

<p>So, I repeat that Mr. Hitchcock’s talk about making an experimental
test of the general value of a parcels post service by putting it
in operation on a few <i>selected</i> rural routes is a joke, <i>or else it is an
evasion in order to delay the installation of a service which every citizen
wants</i>, save, of course, the few individuals who now own and control
our railroads, <i>which individuals also own</i>, to a controlling extent at
least, <i>our express companies</i>.</p>

<p>But I must quote Mr. Hitchcock’s advised legislation in order to
show the reader that Mr. Hitchcock desires that the resulting powers
and authority center in him, or in his successors:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In order that the recommendation on page 10 of this report for the introduction
of a limited parcels post service on rural routes may be promptly carried
into effect, it is suggested that legislation substantially as follows be enacted:</p>

<p>For one year, beginning April 1, 1911, the <i>Postmaster General may, under
such regulations as he shall prescribe</i>, authorize postmasters and carriers on such
rural routes <i>as he shall select</i> to accept for delivery by carrier on the route on which
mailed or on any other route starting at the postoffice, branch postoffice or station
which is the distributing point for that route, or for delivery through any postoffice,
branch postoffice, or station on any of the said routes, <i>at such rates of
postage as he shall determine</i>, packages not exceeding 11 pounds in weight containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
no mail matter of the first class and no matter that is declared by law to
be unmailable, and he shall report to Congress at its next session the results of
this experiment (Page 26, 1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>The italics are mine. They make all the comment that is
necessary in proof of my charge that Mr. Hitchcock seeks powers and
authority which should not be delegated to any bureau head.</p>

<p>As a companion piece to the foregoing Mr. Hitchcock asks the
following legislation&mdash;legislation which, if granted or enacted, must
look to any man who has given even a cursory study to the subject of
parcels post service, as merely a “stall,” a bit of dilatory play to delay
effective and efficient action to install a serviceable parcels post <i>until
the express company interests pull down two or three hundred millions
more of unearned profits</i>.</p>

<p>Following is the companion piece of the last preceding quotation.
The italics are mine and make the only comment that is necessary:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As suggested on page 10 of this report, an investigation should be authorized
as to the conditions under which the transportation of merchandise by mail may
be wisely extended. For this purpose it is recommended that legislation substantially
as follows be enacted:</p>

<p><i>The Postmaster General is hereby directed to ascertain by such investigation
or experiment as is found necessary</i>, and to report to Congress at its next regular
session, the lowest rates of postage at which the Postoffice Department can carry
by mail, without loss, parcels not exceeding 11 pounds in weight; and he is hereby
authorized to place in effect for one year, beginning April 1, 1911, <i>at such postoffices
as he shall select for experimental purposes</i>, such rates of postage on fourth-class
matter <i>as he deems expedient</i>; and the sum of $100,000 is hereby appropriated
to cover any expenses incurred hereunder, including compensation of temporary
employees and rental of quarters in Washington, D. C. (Page 26, 1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>We will here drop the subject of parcels post for the time. In
a later section of this volume I shall discuss the subject&mdash;largely aside
from Mr. Hitchcock’s attempts, as has been authoritatively reported
to me, to delay if not to block its successful installation.</p>

<p>I will make a few more quotations in evidence of Mr. Hitchcock’s
desire to acquire bureaucratic powers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To provide for a postal note in accordance with the plan outlined on pages
10 and 11 it is recommended that legislation substantially as follows be enacted:</p>

<p><i>The Postmaster General may authorize</i> postmasters at such offices <i>as he shall
designate</i>, under such regulations as <i>he shall prescribe</i>, to issue and pay money
orders of fixed denominations not exceeding ten dollars, to be known as postal
notes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> Postal notes shall be valid for six calendar months from the last day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the month of their issue, but thereafter may be paid under such regulations
<i>as the Postmaster General may prescribe</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> Postal notes shall not be negotiable or transferable through indorsement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> If a postal note has been once paid, to whomsoever paid, the United
States shall not be liable for any further claim for the amount thereof. (Page 29,
1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>Let us next look at a peculiar, “an unusual,” request for legislation
granting authority to the Postmaster General to do a most
“unusual” thing, the granting of salaries higher than $1,200 a year to
clerks and carriers, who are paid under the present law $600 a year,
whenever the postmaster “certifies to the department” that “unusual”
conditions in his community prevent him from securing efficient help.
The italics are my own and make comment unnecessary:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In last year’s report, attention was directed to the desirability of authorizing
the appointment of clerks and carriers at higher salaries than $600 at offices where
unusual conditions prevail. Congress added to the appropriation for unusual
conditions a proviso that may have been intended to meet the recommendation
of the department, but subsequent experience has shown that it fails to do so.
The proviso referred to has effected so great a reduction in the amount available
for salaries of employees at offices where conditions are unusual that the service
at a number of such offices cannot be maintained after the close of the present
calendar year, unless additional funds are provided by Congress. The same law
placed a restriction on the maximum salary allowable, making it impossible for
the department to meet satisfactorily the unusual conditions existing in certain
parts of the country. In order that the needed relief may be afforded legislation
substantially as follows should be enacted:</p>

<p>Whenever a postmaster certifies to the department that, owing to unusual
conditions in his community, he is unable to secure the services of efficient employees
at the initial salary provided for postoffice clerks and letter carriers, <i>the
Postmaster General may authorize, in his discretion</i>, the appointment of clerks and
letter carriers for that office at such higher rates of compensation within the
grades prescribed by law as may be necessary in order to insure a proper conduct
of the postal business, and their salaries shall be paid out of the regular appropriation
for compensation of clerks and letter carriers: <i>Provided</i>, That whenever
such action is necessary in order to maintain adequate service at any postoffice
where conditions are unusual <i>the Postmaster General may authorize the appointment
of clerks and letter carriers at salaries higher than $1,200</i>, their salaries to be
paid out of the appropriation for unusual conditions at postoffices. (Page 30,
1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>I wonder what our Postmaster General is after in asking <i>re-enactment</i>
of legislation of this sort, legislation granting him <i>censorial
powers</i> without so much as <i>intimating</i> that fact. Maybe some of you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
organized labor men, or mercantile tradesmen can tell me. I am
listening. <i>So are others.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By the act approved May 27, 1908, making appropriations for the service of
the Postoffice Department, it was provided:</p>

<p>That Section 3893 of the Revised Statutes of the United States be amended
by adding thereto the following: And the term “indecent” within the intendment
of this section shall include <i>matter of a character tending to incite arson, murder,
or assassination</i>.</p>

<p>The enactment of this statute accomplished beneficial results, and it does
not appear that injustice or undue hardship resulted therefrom to any person or
interest. However, the provision quoted was not retained in the penal code
adopted March 4, 1909, and became void when the code went into effect on January
1, 1910. On the assumption that the omission was inadvertent, it is recommended
that the provision be re-enacted. (Page 37, 1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>Following is one more reach by Mr. Hitchcock for bureaucratic
power which should <i>not</i> be granted:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By virtue of his office the Postmaster General has the power to conclude
money-order conventions with foreign countries and to prescribe the fees to be
charged for the issue of international money orders. In like manner he should
be empowered to determine, from time to time, as conditions may warrant, the
fees to be charged for the issue of domestic money orders. It is recommended,
therefore, that Section 2 of the act of January 27, 1894, be repealed, and that as a
substitute therefor legislation substantially as follows be enacted:</p>

<p>Section 2 of the act of January 27, 1894, entitled “An act to improve the
method of accounting in the Postoffice Department and for other purposes,”
is hereby repealed. A domestic money order shall not be issued for more than
one hundred dollars, and the fees to be charged for the issue of such orders <i>shall
be determined, from time to time, by the Postmaster General: Provided, however</i>,
that the scale of fees prescribed in said Section 2 shall remain in force for three
months from the last day of the month in which this act is approved. (Page 38,
1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>I have probably quoted sufficient to show that Postmaster
General Hitchcock is <i>reaching</i> for power and authority <i>which should
not be delegated to any bureau or cabinet head</i>. The last statement
is made, of course, in the confident belief that the reader joins me in
the desire and <i>confident</i> hope that the basic principles of our government
will be neither superseded nor abrogated by legislative grants of
bureaucratic power and authority, which power and authority once
granted is <i>seldom or never recovered to a people without sanguinary
action on their part</i>, with all the waste of effort, vitality, money
and human life usually a concomitant of such action.</p>

<p>There are several more of Postmaster General Hitchcock’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
legislative recommendations I would like to quote, did space permit,
but there is one other which I will quote, because it wears a sort of
humoresque drapery when taken in connection with that “rider” Mr.
Hitchcock so industriously tried to put through the necessary three-ring
stunts required in the senatorial circus; also when taken in
connection with a little, not separately stitched, <i>brochure</i> which Mr.
Hitchcock turns loose on pages 7 and 8 of his most excellent, <i>though
ulteriorly tutoring, report</i>.</p>

<p>On pages 7 and 8 the Postmaster General tells us, as best he can,
under <i>influenced and influencing conditions</i>, the why and wherefore
for his attempt to load his department deficit onto a few periodicals
which he, likewise certain of his “influencers” possibly, does not like.
Well, I want my readers to <i>read</i> this bit of official effort, <i>in a wrong
cause</i>. I want them to read it in the <i>raw</i>, with no spring papering or
decorating on it.</p>

<p>As has been my practice in quoting, I shall take occasion to
italicize a little. But that will not cut any four-leaf clovers this early
in the season. I italicize merely to call the reader’s attention to the
elegant <i>assertiveness</i> of Mr. Hitchcock’s “style” and to his <i>planned</i>
determination to “put it over” on those pestiferous periodicals&mdash;weekly
and monthly&mdash;in spite of <i>constitutional prohibitions</i>, Senate
rules or publishers’ opposition.</p>

<p>Stay! I have another reason for italicizing. I want the reader
to read those italicized phrasings of Mr. Hitchcock’s unstitched
<i>brochure</i> a <i>second</i> time, and to read them more carefully the <i>second</i>
time than he did the first. If the reader will kindly do this we will
be better acquainted, also be mutually better acquainted with Mr.
Hitchcock and his dominating purpose, whether <i>ulterior</i> or other, in
attacking a special class or division of periodical publications in order
to recoup a deficit <i>created wholly by the rural delivery service and by
the free</i> (franked and penalty), <i>service rendered by his department</i>.
We will first quote his little second-class <i>brochure</i> and follow it with
his humoresque legislative recommendation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the last annual report of the department special attention was directed to
the <i>enormous loss the government sustains</i> in the handling and transportation of
second-class mail. Owing to the rapid increase in the volume of such mail <i>the
loss is constantly growing</i>. A remedy should be promptly applied <i>by charging
more postage</i>. In providing for the higher rates it is believed that <i>a distinction
should be made</i> between advertising matter and what is termed <i>legitimate reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
matter</i>. Under present conditions an increase in the postage on reading matter
is not recommended. Such an increase would place a special burden on a large
number of second-class publications, including <i>educational and religious periodicals</i>,
that derive little or no profit from advertising. It is the circulation of this
type of publications, which <i>aid so effectively in the educational and moral advancement
of the people, that the government can best afford to encourage</i>. For these
publications, and also for any other <i>legitimate reading matter in periodical form</i>,
the department favors a continuation of the present low postage rate of 1 cent a
pound, and recommends that the proposed increase in rate be applied only <i>to
magazine advertising matter</i>. This plan would be in full accord with the statute
governing second-class mail, <i>a law that never justified the inclusion under the
second-class rates of the vast amounts of advertising now transported by the government
at a tremendous loss</i>.</p>

<p><i>Newspapers are not included in the plan</i> for a higher rate on advertising
matter because, <i>being chiefly of local distribution</i>, they do not burden the mails to
any such extent as the widely circulating magazines.</p>

<p>Under the system proposed it will be possible, without increasing the expenditure
of public funds, to utilize <i>for the benefit of the entire people</i> that considerable
portion of the postal revenues now expended to <i>meet the cost of a special
privilege</i> enjoyed by certain publishers.</p>

<p>In view of the vanishing postal deficit it is believed that if the magazines
could be required to pay what it costs the government to carry their advertising
pages, <i>the department’s revenues would eventually grow large enough to warrant
1-cent postage on first class mail</i>. Experiments made by the department show that
the relative weights of the advertising matter and the <i>legitimate reading matter
in magazines</i> can be readily determined, making it quite feasible to put into successful
operation the plan outlined. Under that plan each magazine publisher
will be required to certify to the local postmaster, in accordance with regulations
<i>to be prescribed by the department</i>, the facts necessary to determine the proper postage
charges. The method of procedure will be worked out in such manner as to
insure the dispatching of the mails as expeditiously as at present. (Pages 7 and
8, 1910 Report.)</p>

</div>

<p>That sort of a literary hand-out may be all right for certain of our
citizens transplanted from south European environment, likewise
from malnutrition and inanition, by the ship load to this country,
where most of them expected to find $1.50 or $2.00 per day growing
on vines or low bushes&mdash;and found it, in most cases, too.</p>

<p>But to the home-grown American citizen, “His Majesty,” such
departmental literature is a noise something like a “chuck” steak
makes when his hunger suggests a “porter house” and he is without the
price. That is “His Majesty” who <i>earns</i> what he acquires and <i>pays</i>
for what he gets and who does not take on an over-load of the sort of
official talk Mr. Hitchcock ships him in packages similar to the above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Our home-grown American citizens like to have their officials say
something that <i>means</i> something. They do not want any literary
ham-and’s served to them at four prices, they knowing where to
obtain them at first cost.</p>

<p>I intended to make further comment on the foregoing&mdash;or gone&mdash;quotation
from our Postmaster General. I shall, however, deny
myself that pleasure, confidently believing that my italicization of
certain of its phrasings and statements is sufficient comment for the
reader who is following me in this effort to peel the varnish and
frescoe from a <i>planned</i> bad cause.</p>

<p>The reader who has followed me thus far and has not discovered
that I am writing <i>against</i> the men who are, I believe, trying <i>to set
the brakes on legislation in order to serve some</i> “good interest” which
pays them a thousand or more for each of the twelve annual connections
with the cashier or “deposit certificates”&mdash;the reader who, I
say, has followed me thus far and failed to discover that fact should
quit right here. It will not cure him to read the rest of what I shall
say. It is to be worse than what I have previously said; in fact, it
is going to be some distance beyond “the limit.” My advice to any
“frail” reader, therefore, is to quit right at this point and give his
brain a rest until he is able to “come back” <i>and learn something</i>.</p>

<p>We will now take a look at the humoresque “throw” of our
Postmaster General for legislative action. To fully appreciate it, the
reader must bear in mind that Mr. Hitchcock’s division of his 1910
report is of date, December 1st, 1910, and signed by himself. The
reader should furthermore bear in mind that Mr. Hitchcock had
previously reported&mdash;and more frequently <i>asserted</i>&mdash;that the transportation
and handling of second-class mail cost the government 9.23
cents per pound. The reader should, in this instance, likewise take
into his judgmental grinder the fact that Mr. Hitchcock, in the
quotation which follows, is <i>trying to put up another hurdle for the
magazines and other periodicals to jump</i>; that is, for <i>such of them as he
may not like</i>, to jump.</p>

<p>This recommendation for <i>legislative authority</i> is intended to cut
out the sample copy privilege of periodicals, a privilege which the
government should <i>encourage rather than discourage</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In order to discontinue the privilege of mailing sample copies at the cent-a-pound
rate, legislation in substantially the following form is suggested:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>That so much of the act approved March 3, 1885 (23 Stat., 387), as relates
to publications of the second class be amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>“That hereafter all publications of the second-class, except as provided by
Section 25 of the act of March 3, 1879 (20 Stat., 361), when sent to subscribers
by the publishers thereof and from the known offices of publication, or when
sent from news agents to subscribers thereto or to other news agents for the
purpose of sale, shall be entitled to transmission through the mails at one cent
a pound or fraction thereof, such postage to be prepaid as now provided by law.”</p>

</div>

<p>While I have not the act of 1885 at hand, I am aware that it permits
what the Postmaster General asks for, <i>a 1-cent per pound rate</i>
for periodicals admissible under the acts of 1879 and 1885. Mr.
Hitchcock asks for this legislation, a-cent per pound rate, December
1st, 1910.</p>

<p>Before that date and since he has repeatedly asserted, both in
print and “<i>interview</i>,” that second-class mail <i>costs the government
9.23 cents per</i> pound to transport and handle. Do you see the
<i>equivocating</i> “ulterior” in this bit of recommended legislation? If you
do not, just go into the back yard and kick yourself until you awaken
to the fact and then come back and read Mr. Britt’s statement, page
328 of the 1910 report. Britt is Third Assistant Postmaster General
and knows&mdash;well, he knows so much that he has to <i>space-write</i> in
order to fill in about sixty pages of this 1910 report. But, as I have
to take notice of Mr. Britt’s <i>furnished</i> data later, I shall give him no
more attention at this point.</p>

<p>I believe that I have either furnished the evidence to prove the
purpose, <i>the ulterior purpose</i>, of Postmaster General Hitchcock, or of
his <i>influences</i>, to punish certain periodicals, <i>to penalize them for
telling the truth</i>, likewise to acquire bureaucratic powers to give his
department the right of censorship over our periodical literature;
not only that, but to have the successful introduction of a parcels
post <i>dependent on conditions of his own choosing</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PENROSE-OVERSTREET COMMISSION.</span></h2>

<p>Next we will again take notice of Postmaster General Hitchcock’s
peculiar figures. I do not know where he learned how to do it, but his
“figerin’” has any expert accountant on the mat taking the count. He
is certainly a “phenom”&mdash;or his Third Assistant, Mr. Britt, or other
aid, is the “phenom.” At any rate the figures Mr. Hitchcock and his
third “assist” are wonderfully, likewise <i>mysteriously</i>, worked into a
little third-grade problem which makes it look like a proposition in
trigonometry or fluxions.</p>

<p>It’s too complicated for me. I never had the advantage of
hulling beans in Massachusetts. My cornfield arithmetic was all
acquired in Illinois. So, instead of permitting myself to become
enmeshed in Mr. Hitchcock’s figures, I shall resort to my frequently
used tactics. I shall quote.</p>

<p>I have before me several analyses of Mr. Hitchcock’s peculiar
application of the “double-rule-of-three,” as the schoolmaster used to
call it down in that little school house at the cross roads in District
6, Town. 17, R. 3 E. The schoolmaster used to divide his time
between “’rithmetic” and lamming. I graduated with honors in the
latter. ’Rithmetic never seemed to take kindly to me&mdash;save to push
me along in the lamming course. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, that is sufficient explanation to the reader to give broad,
likewise legitimate, grounds for excusing me if I dodge, or try to dodge,
Mr. Hitchcock and his Third Assistant when they get down to
“figerin’.”</p>

<p>Candidly I am at a loss to know why young men of their physical
robustness and their abnormal&mdash;yes, phenomenal&mdash;super-excellence
in the matter of figuring things out, should be frittering away their
time on a loafing job with the government. They ought to be holding
down the chairs of Mathematics and of Expert Accounting at Onion
Run University, or at some other advanced institution of learning.</p>

<p>But, as previously intimated, I am going to quote&mdash;am going to
let someone else into the maelstrom of official figures.</p>

<p>I would not, however, have the reader think for a minute that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
lacked the courage to take the plunge myself. Not at all. I know
my limitations. Mr. Hitchcock is not only a graduate of Harvard,
but he is a graduate of <i>two</i> Republican party campaign committees.
I’d be perfectly willing to take chances against Harvard in any game
of figuring, but when it comes to sitting into the game with a graduate
in two courses of party campaign figuring, one as Secretary and the
other as Manager of the National Republican Committee,&mdash;well,
when it comes to that, I believe the reader will excuse me if I push
some more expert arithmeticians to the front.</p>

<p>I will first quote from the 1907 Joint Commission which investigated
costs of second-class mail haulage and handling, and then I will
quote the publishers whose figures Senator Owen so pertinently
presented in connection with his remarks when speaking in opposition
to the rider, February 25, 1911.</p>

<p>Being perfectly familiar with the proceedings of the Senate
Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, he must, necessarily, have
learned something from the publishers who came with the open, frank&mdash;yes,
certified&mdash;information as to their business. Likewise, he
must have got fairly well acquainted with Mr. Hitchcock and also
have learned something of his <i>promotive</i> methods of figuring.</p>

<p>I have, as yet, not had the pleasure&mdash;the honor&mdash;of meeting
Senator Owen or his strong, clean minded, clean acting colleague,
Senator Gore, but I like them.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><i>Because they stand on the floor of the Senate and fight&mdash;fight for
what is right.</i></p>

<p>Now that I have a copy before me, I will proceed to quote from
that report made by the 1907 commission&mdash;a commission which dug
up more information regarding the haulage and handling of second-class
mail matter than Mr. Hitchcock could possibly have gathered
in two years as head of the Postoffice Department. The commission
was composed of Senators Penrose, Carter and Clay and Congressmen
Overstreet, Moon and Gardner, men far better informed as to
federal postal affairs than is Postmaster General Hitchcock.</p>

<p>This commission was authorized by Congress to make inquiry
regarding second-class mail matter. The reader may remember that
I made reference to this report on a previous page. It presents much
information and collated data, which, if Mr. Hitchcock had studiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
read would have enabled him to avoid many of the egregious blunders
he has made at frequent intervals during the past two years when
discussing the subject. It would, at any rate, have prudently
curbed or restrained what appears in Mr. Hitchcock to be a native
or acquired tendence to volume or tonnage in talk when he is speaking
of second-class mail matters or of the publication and distribution of
periodical literature. I do not concur in a number of the conclusions
of this commission as presented in its report, but no fair-minded man
can read that report without being convinced that the commissioners
delved into the subjects of the classification of second-class mail
matter and the cost, to the government, of its haulage and handling
most earnestly; also as thoroughly and as deeply as the <i>lack of
organization in the Postoffice Department and its antiquated, careless
and inaccurate accounting</i> left it possible for anyone to go.</p>

<p>This commission began its sessions in New York, October 1, 1906.
It sent advance notice to all the organizations of publishers in the
country, to publishers not in organization, to editorial associations,
to boards of trade, mercantile, commercial and trades associations and
to other individuals and organizations that might be interested,
directly or indirectly, in the subject matter to be investigated. It
invited them to present their views, complaints, objections and suggestions
in writing and also to send representatives to present their
views and their grievances, if any, to the commission in person. The
notice and invitation of the commission met with a large response from
the newspapers and other periodical publishers, also from other individuals
and associations interested in the distribution of periodical
literature by reason of the commercial, educational, religious, fraternal,
scientific or other benefits such literature conveyed to the people.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of this commission, the Postoffice Department
prepared and delivered to it “an elaborate statement with exhibits”
to show the “defects of the existing statute as developed in <i>actual
operation</i>.” Also, the then Postmaster General, Mr. George B.
Cortelyou, his Second Assistant, Mr. W. S. Shallenberger, and his
Third Assistant, Mr. Edwin C. Madden, prepared and presented personal
statements to the commission.</p>

<p>Now some readers may wonder why I so particularly present the
work done by this commission for their consideration at this point in
my discussion of the general subject we have under consideration. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
view of my previous statement, to the effect that I do not agree with
some of the conclusions of this “Penrose-Overstreet Commission”
some reader may wonder why I make reference to it at all. Well,
there are several reasons why I do so and do it just at this point in the
consideration of our general subject. Among those reasons are,
briefly stated, the following:</p>

<p>The inquiry and investigation of this commission were broad,
comprehensive and thorough.</p>

<p>Its report presents many arguments, recommendations and conclusions
which must appeal to any man who is fairly well informed as
to our federal postal service, as sound and sensible, however widely
he may differ from the commission’s conclusions on some other
points covered in its report.</p>

<p>Some readers who have seen and read the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission’s report may possibly have concluded that it presents <i>all</i>
the information collected and collated by the commission. The
reader so concluding would, almost necessarily, think the information
it presents insufficient, both in subject matter and in detail, to be as
helpful to the Postmaster General as, on a previous page, I have
asserted the work of this commission would be to Mr. Hitchcock, or
would have been had he taken the trouble to consult the voluminous
but carefully collated data gathered by the 1906-7 commission and on
file in his department.</p>

<p>I will here quote a few lines from the report of the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission in proof of the fact that its inquiry, investigations
and work provided Postmaster General Hitchcock, had he
but taken the time to consult it, a store of information vastly greater
than that presented in its brief official report of sixty-three pages.</p>

<p>Read the following and you will readily understand why Representative
Moon, on March 3, 1911, so strenuously objected to the
appointment of another second-class mail commission and to spending
$50,000 more of the people’s money to investigate a matter
already thoroughly and comprehensively investigated and to
collect and collate data <i>which is already on file in the Postoffice
Department</i>. The quotation is from page 6 of the commission’s
report. The italics are the writer’s:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In accordance with this plan, (outlined in immediately preceding paragraphs),
which operated to economize the time as well of the commission as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
those appearing before it, <i>a great volume of evidence was presented upon all aspects
of the question</i> from the standpoint <i>both of the postal service and of the publications
involved</i></p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>The testimony taken by the commission at these hearings, with statements
submitted in writing by publishers not orally heard, boards of trade, and the like,
and other data collected by the commission in the course of its investigations,
<i>together with a complete digest of such testimony, are embodied in the record of its
proceedings submitted with this report</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>To the end of getting our corner stakes properly located in
order to run our lot-lines correctly, I desire to quote further from the
report of this 1906-7 commission. It says some pertinent things and
<i>says them hard</i>. Before quoting, however, I desire to amplify a little
on the character of that commission, on the general character of the
men composing it as indicated in their official and public action.</p>

<p>The first point of interest for us commoners to note and appreciate
is that the photographs of none of them, so far as I have been able
to learn, have appeared in the rogues’ gallery. We may therefore
presume that they are not only intelligent but “square” men&mdash;men
worthy of Mr. Hitchcock’s consideration and respect as well as our
own.</p>

<p>The second point worthy of note in considering the personnel of
that commission is that none of them, so far as public reports show,
ever had the advantages and opportunities of acquiring that peculiar
and specialized knowledge of federal postal affairs, second-class or
other, which may accrue to men from a postgraduate course in
national party management.</p>

<p>In this connection, however, it may be said that some members
of the commission may have come <i>near</i> to such unusual opportunities
as just mentioned for acquiring expert knowledge of the classification,
transportation and handling of second-class mail.</p>

<p>It is also fitting for me to say in speaking of the gentlemen composing
that 1906-7 commission that, so far as I have been able to
look up their biographies in the Congressional Directory and elsewhere,
I find nothing to indicate that any of them ever tried to rob a smokehouse
nor have any of them ever tried to put over any piece of
“frame-up” legislation of the nature of Mr. Hitchcock’s “rider,”
printed on a previous page&mdash;<i>legislation to hobble, punish or ruin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
periodicals honest enough and independent enough to tell the truth to a
hundred millions of people</i>.</p>

<p>The foregoing are some of the reasons&mdash;there are many others&mdash;why
I think the membership of that Penrose-Overstreet Commission
of 1906-7 was possessed of an ability, character and qualification to
have commanded Mr. Hitchcock’s careful consideration of the information
and data the commission so carefully collated, after thorough
investigation, and submitted with its official report.</p>

<p>“Maybe he did make a careful study of that collated data?”</p>

<p>Yes, maybe he did. But if he did, then much of the “student
discipline” and of the “study habit,” which graduates of Harvard are
presumed to have acquired, must have lapsed in the shuffle of the
cards from which recent years have dealt his hands. I say this
respectfully as well as candidly.</p>

<p>I cannot think of it as possible for a man of Mr. Hitchcock’s
known intellectual gauge to read&mdash;<i>studiously read</i>&mdash;the facts as
presented in the testimony before that 1906-7 commission, or so
read even the 63-page official report signed by five of the commissioners
(Representative Gardner being ill at the time the report was
submitted)&mdash;I cannot, I say, think it possible for any man of Mr.
Hitchcock’s admitted intelligence to read that testimony, collated
data and report, and then proceed to talk or write so wide of <i>known
facts</i> as does he in parts of his 1909 and 1910 reports and in his letters
to Senator Penrose, printed in previous pages.</p>

<p>It may be&mdash;yes, it is most probable&mdash;that the commission did not
dig out <i>all</i> the facts. But admitting that, the further admission must
be made by any fair-minded man that most of the facts it <i>did dig
out</i> appear to be the very facts which Postmaster General Hitchcock
<i>ignored</i>&mdash;ignored with the self-centered nonchalance of a “short
story” cowboy when “busting” a broncho before an audience.</p>

<p>I shall now present a few statements from the report of that
commission, first quoting some of the arguments presented by publishers
who appeared at its hearings personally or by representatives,
or who presented their views in writing on the various phases of
the questions under consideration. The quotations made, the reader
must understand to be the commission’s summary of what the publishers
testified to, criticised or recommended, and not the full testimony
or reports as made by the publishers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I have taken the liberty to italicize certain phrases and sentences
in these quotations, my purpose being, of course, to bring the points
so italicized more particularly to the reader’s notice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The primary purpose and function of the postal service being the transportation
of government and letter mail, second, third, and fourth class matter are not
strictly chargeable with that proportion of the total cost of the service which
would be equivalent to their proportion of total weight or volume, but these
secondary classes, on the contrary, are chargeable only with that fraction of total
cost which would remain after deducting all expenses of installation and general
management involved in the maintenance of a complete postal service for government
and letter mail. This method of computation should be applied not only in
respect of the expenses of administration and handling, but especially in respect
of the expense of railway mail transportation, in which, by reason of the sliding
scale of payment, the additional burden of second-class matter entailed but <i>an
infinitesimal additional cost</i>. As an illustration of this point, attention was
drawn to the statement of Dr. Henry C. Adams, in his report to the commission
of 1898 (p. 404), that <i>if the volume of mail had been decreased so that the ton-mileage
had been 169,809,000 instead of 272,000,000, the railway mail pay would
have been practically the same</i>.</p>

<p>In other words, the argument is that the true cost of second-class matter is
merely that part of total cost which <i>would be saved if second-class matter were
now eliminated</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing is from page 9 of the commission’s report. On the
same page of the report it gives a summary of another set of reasons
presented by the publishers in their argument in support of their
contention that the mail rate on second-class matter should be low:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That second-class matter, by reason of the fact that it is handled largely in
bulk in full sacks already routed and separated and requires little or no handling
by the railway mail service or the force at the office of mailing and of delivery, is
in fact the <i>least expensive class of matter</i>. With respect to the proportion so routed
and separated, it was variously estimated by the publishers as from <i>70 to 93</i> per
cent of the total weight. The assistant postmaster at New York fixed the percentage
for his office at <i>67 per cent</i>, and the assistant postmaster at Chicago estimated
it, for the country at large, to be between 50 and 60 per cent.</p>

<p>The representative of the <i>American Newspaper Publishers’ Association</i>,
speaking for the metropolitan daily press, stated that less than <i>6 per cent of their
circulation went into the mail at all</i>, in many instances the proportion being as low
as two-thirds of 1 per cent; that the radius of circulation was not more than 150
miles; that their mailings averaged <i>49 pounds per sack</i>, and that 93 per cent of all
second-class matter going out of New York city, for example, <i>was already sorted
and routed</i>. It was admitted, however, that while the newspapers <i>avail themselves
of express and railway transportation</i> for matter sent out in bulk, single
copies sent to individual subscribers invariably went by mail.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock appears to have largely ignored
the fact so clearly pointed out by the publishers in 1906&mdash;yes, pointed
out as long ago as 1898&mdash;that second-class mail matter is a <i>large
producer of the revenues</i> received by the government from mail matter
of the first, third and fourth classes. Following is a summary of
what the publishers pointed out to the 1906-7 commission:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is an immense indirect revenue on second-class matter, due to the fact
that second-class matter is itself the cause of a great volume of first-class matter,
upon which the department reaps a handsome profit. While the extent to which
first-class matter is thus indebted to second-class matter is necessarily indeterminate,
attempts were made to illustrate it by particular instances. This was done
by computing the amount of first-class mail arising, first, from the direct correspondence
between a publisher and the readers, and secondly, from correspondence,
between the readers and the advertisers, resulting from the insertion of the advertisements.
In the instances chosen, the first-class matter thus stimulated appeared
to be very considerable. Upon this basis it was argued that any reduction
in the volume of second-class matter would inevitably be followed by a corresponding
reduction in first-class matter. This would not only deprive the Postoffice
Department of the revenue from the first-class matter, <i>but by diminishing the
total weight of the mails would correspondingly increase the rate of mail pay</i>, so that
the net result of the elimination of the socially valuable second-class matter would
be an actual increase in the total cost of the service.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing is taken from pages 12 and 13 of the commission’s
report. I desire to quote further from page 13&mdash;four paragraphs&mdash;and
I urge they be read with care. The reader, too, should remember
that this is not <i>all</i> that the publishers said on the points touched upon.
It is, however, no doubt a fair epitome or summary of what they said
or wrote to the commission. The reader should also keep in mind the
fact that what they said and wrote was said and written in 1906, and
<i>all</i> they said and wrote is on file and easily accessible to Postmaster
General Hitchcock:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Within an average radius of 500 miles the express companies and railways
stand willing to transport second-class matter, in bulk packages weighing not less
than 5 to 10 pounds to a single address or to be called for, at rates actually lower
than the second-class postage rate. Inasmuch as the average haul of second-class
matter was reported by the Wolcott commission (p. 319), to be but 438 miles,
it is impossible that the government should lose anything upon the transportation
of this class of matter, or if in fact it should be found to be doing so, <i>the loss must
arise from an overpayment to the railways</i>.</p>

<p>Even if it should be found that second-class matter was being carried at a
distinct loss, that loss would be entirely justified by the <i>educational value of the
periodical press</i>. From the beginning of the republic it had been the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Congress to foster and assist the dissemination of information and intelligence
among the people. Next to the great public school systems maintained by the
states, the newspaper and periodical are the chief agency of social progress and
enlightenment. So far from this being a subsidy to the publisher the advantage
of the low postage rate had been passed on to the subscriber in the form of a better
periodical and a more efficient service. Any substantial increase in the postal
rates, while for the time being bearing heavily on the publisher, must eventually
fall upon the subscriber, either in the form of an increased price for his reading
matter or of a deterioration in the quality of that matter.</p>

<p>The correct method of dealing with the question of cost is to treat the service
as a whole, and if the revenue for the whole service, <i>including allowance for
government mail</i>, meets the cost of the whole service, it is immaterial whether each
class of that service pays its own cost, or even whether the cost of one class has to
be made up by a greater charge upon other classes.</p>

<p>With respect to rates, with the exception of some of the representatives of the
<i>stockyards journals</i>, periodical publications were a unit against any increase. It
was urged that the periodical publishing business has been built up on the present
second-class rates, and that a change from 1 cent a pound to 4 cents, as suggested
by the Third Assistant Postmaster General, would cripple, if not destroy, every
existing periodical. While some would, perhaps, be able to adjust their business
to the new rates and survive, the majority would perish, and the loss would fall
heaviest on the smaller and weaker periodicals.</p>

</div>

<p>We will next note some things which that 1906-7 commission said
on its own account or quotes some one in whose opinion they concurred
or did not, as the case might be.</p>

<p>Some pages back, I told the reader, in effect, that while this
commission’s official report was a good one, presenting some valuable
suggestions, I did not agree with certain of its recommendations and
conclusions. Now, any adverse criticisms I intend to make concerning
that report are, I think, best made right here, after which I will
quote a few paragraphs from it which I believe highly commendable.
There are many suggestions and recommendations that I believe
would be of great value did the department but act upon them, and
the vast amount of data the commission collected and made a digest
of would, had he but looked into it carefully, most certainly have
<i>persuaded</i> Postmaster General Hitchcock to speak and write less
loosely on the subjects of second-class mail rates and periodical
publication and distribution, induced him to talk in a way that would
not leave the impression with studious, thoughtful auditors and
readers that he got his opinions at a bargain sale during its rush hours.</p>

<p>I shall comment adversely on but a few points of the commission’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
report. Three of its members (Senators Carter and Clay
and Representative Overstreet) have <i>passed</i>&mdash;not off the edge of life
but to official retirement, or, maybe, to the political morgue. They, in
time, may be able to “come back.” The Man on the Ladder has heard
varied opinions&mdash;some of them decidedly variegated, too&mdash;anent the
probability of those three gentlemen coming back. Personally I am
not sufficiently acquainted with their official service careers to justify
the expression of an opinion of them. If, while in office, they directed
their efforts and activities to a service of their constituents and the
interests of the people in general, let us hope they may “come back.”
On the other hand, if while in office they were but working models
of the so-called “practical” politician, then, as a matter both of self-respect
and of duty, we must hope they stay in the morgue.</p>

<p>“The ‘practical’ politician is the <i>working</i> politician.”</p>

<p>Well, yes, that may be. But most of those within range of my
vision from the ladder top appear to be devoting their most active
and strenuous industry to “working” the people.</p>

<p>No, I do not like that type of human animal popularly designated
as a “practical” politician. Especially do I not like him in public
office&mdash;executive, legislative or judicial&mdash;elective or appointive, and I
have run the lines on a good many of them. Most of them when in
positions of official power and <i>opportunity</i> act as if their consciences
had been handed down in original packages direct from their jungle
ancestors. At any rate most of those in positions of official power and
authority seem to follow one working rule, and follow it, too, both
industriously and consistently.</p>

<p><i>To conceal one theft, steal more.</i></p>

<p>The typical “practical” politician, when holding down a public
office, usually holds-up the people. They pose and talk as courageous
patriots and <i>large</i> thinkers. Under close scrutiny, however, most of
them will show up or show down merely as <i>discreet private or personal
interest liars</i>.</p>

<p>But I have permitted my field glass to ramble from the specific
to the general. Whether the three <i>passed</i> members of the 1906-7
commission are politically dead or taking only a temporarily enforced
rest, the situation is one which suggests the propriety of that subdued
and respectful tone one is expected to use when standing by as a
friend is lowered to an enforced rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall now offer my strictures of a few recommendations made by
the 1906-7 commission and of some of the arguments the commission’s
report offers to their support.</p>

<p>The first objection I find to the report of this Penrose-Overstreet
Commission is that several of its paragraphs indicate that the commission
appears to have been afflicted with Mr. Hitchcock’s current
ailment&mdash;an ingrown idea that some action, legislative or other,
must be taken in order to curb the circulation growth and keep
down the piece or copy-weight of periodicals. To The Man on the
Ladder such an idea is not only faulty to the point of foolishness but
it violates long established and successfully applied business practices
in the transportation and handling of goods or commodities, whatever
their character. The idea, it would appear, is based upon an oft-repeated
but nevertheless false statement of fact, to the effect that
the government is losing money in the carriage and handling of second-class
mail at the cent-a-pound rate.</p>

<p>The falsity of that statement I shall conclusively prove to the
reader later, if he will be so indulgent as to follow me. Here I shall
say only this: If the government has ever lost a cent in rail or other
haulage and handling of second-class mail matter, such loss has been
<i>wholly the result of excessive payments to railroads, Star Route and
ocean carriers, to political rather than business management and to
permitted raiding of the postal revenues in various ways&mdash;from overmanning
the official and service force to downright thievery</i>.</p>

<p>I have adverted on a previous page to the stealings of the Machen-Beavers
gang, exposed by the investigation of Joseph L. Bristow, and
a stench still exhales from the Star Route lootings exposed some years
previous. In the Star Route case, the waste&mdash;a more fitting word is
thievery&mdash;the stealing was largely effected through the medium of
“joker”-loaded or unnecessary contracts, the contracts running to
the advantage of some thief who “stood in” with the party in power.</p>

<p>Nor has all the Star Route grafting and stealing been stopped,
though both Postmaster General Hitchcock and his recent
predecessor, Mr. George B. Cortelyou, deserve great praise for having
eliminated much of it, and Mr. Hitchcock’s active, continued efforts
to further clean out that Augean stable must command the hearty
approval of every honest citizen. But, as just stated, some of the
original graft and steal still lingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Last year I personally investigated one Star Route. It was a
twenty-mile drive (round trip). The contractor was receiving
$600 or more a year for the service. What he paid the villager to
cover the route with his patriarchal team I do not know. The
villager, however, picked up a little on the side by hauling over his
drive local parcels, some merchandise and an occasional passenger.
I watched his mail deliveries to the village office for ten days. On
no day did the revenue to the government <i>exceed sixty cents, and on
seven of the ten days it was below twenty cents. One day it was but
ten cents.</i></p>

<p>In this connection it should also be mentioned that the village
which that Star Route was presumed to serve was on a regular rural
route and received fully 95% of its mail by special carrier service
connecting with a trunk line station only six miles away.</p>

<p>But to return to my objection to the manifest efforts of the Postmaster
General and of recommendations in the Penrose-Overstreet
report to adopt methods or secure legislation to restrain increase in
both the circulation and the copy-weight of periodicals. Of course
if the government really sustains a loss on the carriage and handling
of second-class matter, the loss would be greater on 160 tons than on
80 tons. I, however, contend, and shall later prove, that&mdash;barring
waste, payroll loafing and stealage&mdash;the government now transports
and handles second-class matter at a profit.</p>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock, so far as I have found time to
read him, has made no particular effort to restrict or limit the piece
or copy-weight of periodicals. He was, seemingly at least, so occupied
in his efforts to “get” a few periodicals through the means of that
unconstitutional “rider” of his that he had little or no time for anything
else. But the 1906-7 commission boldly advocated a <i>penalizing</i>
of periodical <i>weight</i> for copies mailed to piece, or individual, addresses.</p>

<p>A table of graduated increases is given and some very peculiar
argument, to put it mildly, is presented to support the recommended
scale, or system, of weight penalization. Following I quote from
pages 28-29 of the commission’s report. The italics are mine:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The rate then for copy service would be one-eighth of a cent per copy not to
exceed <i>2 ounces</i>, one-quarter cent per copy not to exceed 4 ounces, and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cent for each additional 4 ounces or fraction thereof to be prepaid in money as
second-class postage is now paid. Tabulated, it would appear thus:</p>

<table summary="Postage rates by weight">
  <tr>
    <td>Not exceeding&mdash;</td>

<p>The net result calculated by the pound will be, upon the periodicals above
the average weight of 4 ounces and not exceeding a pound, a change from 1 to
about 1¾ cents per pound. For heavier periodicals the rate would average 1⅞ <i>cents
per pound</i> for those weighing 2 pounds, and increasing by an <i>infinitesimal</i> fraction
with the proportion of weight above 4 ounces but never reaching, no matter how
heavy the periodical may grow, the limit of 2 cents per pound.</p>

<p>While the actual increase of rate upon the <i>normal</i> periodical, especially in
view of the publisher’s right at all times to send it by bulk at a cent a pound, would
be so small as not to upset his business, there would be two advantages to the
postal revenue, one at each end of the line.</p>

<p>(1) The making of a definite minimum charge for the handling of the
individual piece. (2) Increase of revenue as the periodical grows heavier,
due to the fact that the initial rate of one-quarter cent for 4 ounces is <i>less than
the incremental rate</i>.</p>

<p>This system of payment by the individual piece with a minimum limit of
weight and an increased rate for each increment of weight is <i>common to the postal
systems of the entire world</i> with the exceptions of Canada and the United States.
The only difference is that in the present project the incremental rate is higher
than the initial rate.</p>

<p>Although this graduated scale would appear to be more favorable to the
smaller periodical than to the large one, it must be borne in mind that the periodical
weighing <i>less than 1 ounce</i> and of necessity paying the initial rate of <i>one-quarter
cent</i> would be paying a rate (2 cents per pound), slightly greater than the
large periodical. This increase upon the periodical weighing less than 2 ounces
finds ample justification in the obvious fact that the expense of handling second
class matter is not to be measured simply by gross weight. On the contrary, as
was pointed out by the representatives of the publishers in comparing the cost of
handling second-class with that of first-class mail, such expense is to be measured
by the number of pieces handled and frequency of handling. <i>A pound of periodicals
which is made up of 10 or 12 or, as is sometimes the case, 30 or 40 separate
pieces, each one of which requires a separate course of handling and delivery, can not
with justice be treated as the equivalent of a pound of matter which requires but two,
or, at most, four courses of handling and delivery.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>This increase would be offset, moreover, for the <i>normal</i> periodical weighing
less than 2 ounces, the country weekly, by the retention of the free county
privilege.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing is substantially the commission’s <i>whole</i> argument,
save a little more talk about “normal” periodicals, “normal” weeklies,
and a statement to the effect that all countries, other than the United
States and Canada, increase the piece, or copy, postage rate as the
weight of the periodical increases&mdash;that is, these other countries do
not give a <i>flat</i> pound, gram or other unit of weight rate.</p>

<p>Now, I shall briefly state my objections to some points in the
above quotation&mdash;those points I have italicized.</p>

<p>The reader, however, must bear in mind that the scale of increase
in mail rates above reprinted applies <i>only to single copies</i>&mdash;to copies
mailed to individual addresses. For copies mailed in <i>bulk</i>, in packages
weighing not less than ten pounds, to some agent of the publisher or
other individual, to be taken up by the agent or individual at train
or at central postoffice, the commission recommended the cent-a-pound
rate.</p>

<p>In adverse criticism of the commission’s argument for penalizing
<i>weight</i>, because all foreign countries do so, I need but say:</p>

<p>1. There are more high-class newspapers&mdash;papers which,
necessarily, have weight&mdash;published in this country <i>than is published
in all the rest of the world</i>.</p>

<p>2. There are four times as many of what the 1906-7 commission&mdash;also
Postmaster General Hitchcock&mdash;would class as “periodicals”
published in this country <i>as are published in all the rest of the world</i>.</p>

<p>Sounds “loud,” does it? Well, look into the matter. Maybe
I am mistaken. If so, it is a mistake made after thirty years of study
of the conditions controlling in my country&mdash;in <i>your</i> country&mdash;and
of the prices paid in other countries for <i>efficient, satisfactory
service</i>.</p>

<p>3. Those “other countries”&mdash;the stronger ones, at any rate&mdash;either
<i>own</i> or <i>absolutely control</i> the railroads which transport their
mails. In some of them, rail transportation of mails&mdash;also of government
officials, the service personnel of the army and the navy, and of
other government “weight”&mdash;are <i>carried free of charge</i>.</p>

<p>4. Those “other countries,” of which so much is said and
written ostensibly for our enlightenment, have gone through the mill&mdash;their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
peoples have been <i>ground fine</i> in mills of sophistry and special
pleadings, to which, <i>for fifty years</i>, we have been carrying our grists.</p>

<p>5. Those “other countries” are making their mail service a
source of <i>governmental revenue</i>.</p>

<p>The people of this country, today, no more expect a revenue
from the government’s postal service than they expect it from the
War, the Navy, the Interior, the Judicial or other service department.</p>

<p>The people want <i>service</i>, not revenues, from any federal service
department.</p>

<p>And you gentlemen who vote away the people’s money for services
<i>not</i> rendered&mdash;which you <i>know</i> will not be rendered when you
vote to “burn” the money&mdash;will, before those independent periodicals
are through with the recent sand-bagging attempt to censor
or control their <i>published thought</i>&mdash;you will learn, I mean to say, that
people want <i>service</i> not revenues; that they want “duty,” as an
engineer would name it, not a <i>coached</i> prattle about B. T. U. or other
legislative and official thermics.</p>

<p>Now, let us look back at that quotation&mdash;at some of the points
in it I have italicized.</p>

<p>First paragraph quoted: Aside from small country dailies&mdash;now
carried by mail to addresses inside the county of publication free&mdash;and
fraternal papers, Sunday School sheets and similar publications,
there are few periodicals published in this country which weigh two
ounces or less.</p>

<p>First paragraph following tabulation: “The rate would average
1⅞ cents per pound” for periodicals weighing two pounds.</p>

<p>A glance at the table shows that the piece or copy rate on a
periodical weighing 28 ounces is given as 3¼ cents. A periodical
weighing two pounds, or 32 ounces, would be charged a half cent more,
or 3¾ cents for mail carriage and delivery, instead of 2 cents as now.</p>

<p>Second paragraph following the table, also in last paragraph
quoted: “Normal” periodicals.</p>

<p>What is a “normal” periodical? Are the 4 or 8 page weeklies
published in the back counties and the small religious, college, Sunday
school and fraternal sheets that weigh two ounces or less “normal”
periodicals? Are the dailies of our large cities, weighing from four
to twelve ounces, “normal” periodicals? Is the Saturday Evening
Post, weighing from ten to twenty ounces a “normal” periodical?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Are any of the periodicals in the following descriptive list “normal?”</p>

<p>The newspapers and other periodicals named in the following
tabulation are those I could find within convenient, likewise hurried,
reach. I tried to get them as near concurrent dates as I
could. The tabulation will show the reader the proportion of
advertising to body matter, printed in the different periodicals on
the dates named.</p>

<p>Readers particularly interested in the data presented in the
tabulation should, however, understand that for the newspapers
listed, no account was taken of the “write-up” or “promotion”
advertising printed as reading matter. Some newspapers, at certain
times, carry a considerable amount of such paid matter while
the standard monthly and weekly periodicals carry little or none
of it at any time:</p>

<p>Next to last paragraph: Note the statement that “the periodical
weighing less than one ounce” must “of necessity” pay the “initial
rate of one-quarter cent” or “two cents per pound.”</p>

<p>The initial rate as given in the table is but one-eighth of a cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
That would make a per copy mail rate of two cents per pound, whereas
an initial rate of one-quarter cent per copy would make four-page
sheets and leaflets “normal” periodicals weighing less than one ounce
pay at a rate of four cents per pound.</p>

<p>Next, note the <i>crossed</i> argument in the paragraph just referred
to. The commission seems to accept the argument made by the
publishers&mdash;that it cost less to handle a pound of mail made up of but
one to four pieces than it costs to handle a pound made up of from
ten to fifty pieces. That is a fact which admits of no controversy, is
it not?</p>

<p>Then why did this commission advise the adoption of a flat rate
of increase of two cents a pound (one-half cent for each four ounces), as
the mail rate on periodicals weighing more than four ounces.</p>

<p>If the argument of the paragraph just cited is sound&mdash;and it certainly
is sound&mdash;a just graduation of the mail charge for the carriage
and piece handling of the heavier periodicals should scale downwards
and not continue a flat rate, especially not continue at a flat rate on
increase in weight that is greatly excessive, as two cents a pound
certainly is.</p>

<p>I shall speak further of periodical weights later in connection
with railway mail pay and car rentals. The report of this 1906-7
commission in various other paragraphs manifests a clear intent to
restrict and, if possible, to curtail the expansion of second-class mail
matter, not only by curbing the enlargement of periodicals in size
by increasing the second-class rate and by penalizing added
weight, but by putting restrictions upon the periodical publisher which
must necessarily make it more difficult for him to increase his circulation.
These restrictions, so far as yet expressed, apply to the
publisher’s sample copy privileges and to the amount of advertising
a periodical may carry.</p>

<p>On page 48 of its report the commission, speaking of methods to
curb a periodical’s growth in both circulation and weight, advises
that the following be covered into the law in lieu of certain phrasings
now in the statutes and which, the commission asserts, have proved
quite inadequate in restraining periodicals from expanding their
circulation beyond a point which they are pleased to call “normal.”
They advise that the law “enforce the requirement that the periodical
may be issued and circulated <i>only in response to a public demand</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>In the draft of a bill which this 1906-7 commission recommends
become a law, the following are the means by which circulation “only
in response to a public demand” will be attained:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) By reducing to a <i>minimum the sample copy, which is one of the main
agencies of inflation</i>. The legitimate periodical employing this means only to a
slight extent will not be at all affected.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By abolishing all premiums, whether of printed matter or merchandise.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By either prohibiting all combination offers, as, for example, a set of
books with a magazine, or requiring that in all cases a price shall be set upon both
elements of the combination and that the full advertised price of the periodical be
paid.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) By requiring that the publication shall print conspicuously, not only
its regular subscription price, but any reduced price at which it is offered in clubbing
arrangements and the like.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) By providing that all copies which the postmaster, in the exercise of
due diligence shall be unable to deliver, shall be returned with a postage-due stamp
for an amount equal to double the third-class rate. In other words, charge the
publisher the third-class rate both for the forwarding and the returning of any
copy sent otherwise than in response to an actual demand.</p>

</div>

<p>To The Man on the Ladder the commission’s talk, advising the
enforcement of “the requirements that the periodical may be issued
and circulated only in <i>response to a public demand</i>” (page 40 of report),
reads much like one of two things&mdash;either the inconsidered or ill-considered
prattle of persons who want to say <i>something</i>, or the argument
of <i>ulterior motive</i>&mdash;of a covert <i>purpose</i> to restrict, to cripple, to
<i>kill</i> the greatest instrument for the education of its <i>adult</i> citizens which
any nation of earth has to date discovered&mdash;an instrument that is
economically within easy reach of its exchequer.</p>

<p>How much of a “public demand” does the reader think there
would have been for the reaper, for the thrashing machine, for the
case-hardened, steel shared plow, for the sewing machine, for the
triple expansion engine, for the traveling crane, for any brand of
breakfast food, of ham, of flour, books&mdash;in short, how much of “public
demand” would there have been for any of the mechanical inventions,
for any of the multitude of betterments in the housing,
clothing and subsisting of our people, <i>had not that “public demand”
been created</i>? No one wants anything, however excellent it may be,
until his attention is called to it and he believes it will <i>aid him or her</i>,
as the case may be, that it will lighten the stress of labor or increase
its product, or in other lines and directions improve the conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
their lives, industrially or otherwise. Ninety-nine per cent of “public
opinion,” as to whether or not that public wants or does not want
this, that or the other thing is <i>influenced</i>&mdash;is promoted by what it
<i>senses</i> in personal contact with the thing or by what it hears said
of it or <i>reads of it</i>.</p>

<p>That statement is as true of the members of the 1906-7 commission
and of Postmaster General Hitchcock as it is of Mr. William
Mossback of Mossville, Connecticut. The “demand” of each of us&mdash;our
<i>desire</i> to possess this or that&mdash;is prompted&mdash;<i>is created</i>&mdash;by what
we see, hear, feel, taste, smell or <i>read</i> of it. We stand at the head
of the nations of earth for progress in the various fields of mechanical
improvement, from kitchen utensils to laundry equipment, from the
plow to the electric crane. What is true of the progress of our people
through the adoption of labor-saving mechanical devices, implements
and machinery is correspondingly true in various other fields of progress&mdash;a
progress largely the result of promoted “demand” for the
better things, for the improvements of which our people have <i>read</i>
in our newspapers and in our monthly and weekly publications&mdash;yes,
read of in the advertisements and in descriptive write-ups of such
periodicals, if you will have it so.</p>

<p>So this prattle about issuing a periodical “only to public demand”
is not only prattle&mdash;it is not only unsound and unbusinesslike both
in theory and service practice, but it is also a <i>stealthy attempt to
garrote the facts</i>, likewise an attempt to subject the great publishing
interests of the country to the <i>rankest kind of injustice</i>.</p>

<p>How is the publisher to secure additional subscribers if he be
denied mailing privilege to sample copies?</p>

<p>True, the bill recommended by this commission would allow the
publisher to mail sample copies to the extent of ten per cent of his
subscribed issue. Mr. Hitchcock, however, as I shall shortly show,
proposes to exclude <i>all</i> sample copies from the mails.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from Mr. Hitchcock’s 1910 report and
shows that the Postoffice Department, as at present directed, is
determined to curb the growth and development of periodical literature
in this country in every way possible&mdash;ways that scruple not at
<i>biased rulings and grossly unjust distinctions</i>. In the following Mr.
Hitchcock is after what he is pleased to designate as an “abuse of the
sample-copy privilege.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to discontinue the privilege of mailing sample copies at
the cent-a-pound rate, legislation in substantially the following form
is suggested:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That so much of the act approved March 3, 1885 (23 Stat., 387), as relates
to publications of the second class be amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>“That hereafter all publications of the second-class, except as provided by
Section 25 of the act of March 3, 1879 (20 Stat., 361), <i>when sent to subscribers</i>
by the publishers thereof and from the known offices of publication, or when sent
from news agents to subscribers thereto or to other news agents for the purpose of
sale, <i>shall be entitled to transmission through the mails at one cent a pound or fraction
thereof</i>, such postage to be prepaid as now provided by law.”</p>

</div>

<p>In drafting the above recommended legislation Mr. Hitchcock no
doubt was greatly assisted by the luminous suggestions, advice,
analyses, etc., of his Third Assistant, Mr. Britt, to be found on pages
331 and 332 of the 1910 report&mdash;which suggestions, advice, etc., is
based largely on “estimates”&mdash;“estimates” which any student or
careful observer of the Postoffice Department methods of figuring
and accounting will readily discern are, in several particulars, somewhat
“influenced,” if not, indeed, “fixed.”</p>

<p>Up to January 1, 1908, periodical publishers were allowed to mail
sample copies of any issue in number equal to that of their subscribed
lists. Acting on the recommendation of the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission, no doubt approved by Mr. Hitchcock, the mailing
privilege on sample copies was cut down, January 1, 1908, to 10 per
cent of the subscribed issue. Now comes Mr. Hitchcock with a bit
of recommended legislation, as quoted above, which would, if favorably
acted upon by Congress, deny the mailing privilege to <i>all</i>
sample copies at the cent-a-pound rate.</p>

<p>Though not pertinent to the subject immediately under consideration,
I desire here to call the reader’s attention again to a point
in Mr. Hitchcock’s recommended legislation as quoted above&mdash;a point
which is conspicuously worthy of a second notice and to which I
have called attention on a previous page.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock’s report, from which the foregoing piece of recommended
legislation is quoted, bears date of December 1, 1910. Keep
that in mind. In that recommendation he would grant a <i>continuance</i>
of the cent-a-pound postage rate on periodicals “sent to subscribers,”
but to such only. No sample copies are to be carried and handled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mind you, at the cent-a-pound rate after Mr. Hitchcock’s recommendation
becomes law&mdash;that is, if it ever does become law.</p>

<p>Now, the subscribed mailings of any periodical&mdash;newspaper or
other&mdash;are piece or single-copy mailings, which are admittedly the
most expensive or costly to the government to transport and handle.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Hitchcock recommends that <i>the cent-a-pound rate shall
continue to be extended to such single copies</i>&mdash;a most just and sensible
recommendation.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hitchcock when he wrote that bit of recommended
legislation was thinking&mdash;and thinking only, if indeed he gave the
subject any <i>personal</i> thought at all&mdash;of curbing the circulation growth
of periodicals and, as a means to that end, recommends the exclusion
of all sample copies from the pound-rate privilege.</p>

<p>Read carelessly or superficially that bit of suggested legislation in
itself does not appear to have anything to do with sample copies.
On second and more careful reading, however, its purpose becomes
clear. If the cent-a-pound rate is to be allowed only to regularly
<i>subscribed</i> copies of a periodical, then <i>all</i> sample copies must be mailed,
if mailed at all, at the third-class rate&mdash;<i>must pay eight cents a pound</i>.</p>

<p>When it comes to covering or cloaking ulterior purpose or intent
in legislation, Mr. Hitchcock is an expert, it would appear from the
rider he so strenuously tried to put astride the 1911-12 postoffice
appropriation bill, and from the foregoing as well as some others of his
suggestions to Congress. But the point to which I more especially
desire to call to the reader’s attention when I obtruded that last
preceding quotation at a point where it interrupted a consideration
of the Penrose-Overstreet Commission’s report was this:&mdash;</p>

<p>As previously stated, Mr. Hitchcock’s 1910 report bears date,
December 1, 1910. On that date, as appears from the last quotation,
he desired a law that would bar all sample copies from the mails at
the present second-class rate. It also appears that Mr. Hitchcock at
the date named&mdash;December, 1, 1910&mdash;desired that all periodicals
issued, except sample copies, <i>be carried, as now, at the cent-a-pound rate</i>.</p>

<p>Somewhere around February 1, 1911&mdash;<i>barely two months after he
makes that cent-a-pound recommendation</i>&mdash;we hear Mr. Hitchcock
assertively declaring, and contentiously arguing, that it costs the
government <i>9.23 cents per pound</i> to transport and handle second-class
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened to his mental gear in so short a time to induce so
<i>loud</i> a change in his mind?</p>

<p>Or was it a change of mind? On page 328 of that 1910 departmental
report, Mr. Britt, Third Assistant Postmaster General, who
has charge of the accounting division of the service, makes the bold
statement that it cost the government $62,438,644.70 more to carry
and handle the second-class mail last year than was received for the
service. Being an “expert” figurer Mr. Britt found no difficulty in
arriving at that absurd 9.23 cents a pound as the <i>actual cost</i> to the
government of carrying and handling second-class mail. On pages
7 and 8 of the report, Mr. Hitchcock himself gives publicity to a
conviction that the cent-a-pound rate should be increased on certain
periodicals&mdash;<i>the magazines</i>&mdash;generously suggesting that the increased
rate be confined to their “advertising pages” only. In the loosely
worded “rider” he carelessly&mdash;<i>or purposely</i>&mdash;uses the word “sheets”
in place of the word “pages” as used in his report.</p>

<p>Still, in face of his Third Assistant’s lofty figuring, the conclusions
of which are announced on page 328 of the report, and of his own
statement of the “reasons for an increase of rate” on periodicals of the
<i>magazine class</i>, for carrying and handling their “advertising pages”&mdash;in
face of these statements, how did his mental gear so slip, or “jam,”
as to induce him to recommend, on page 35 of this <i>same</i> report, the
enactment of a law continuing the cent-a-pound rate on <i>all</i> periodicals
mailed, except sample copies?</p>

<p>Did he intentionally double cross both himself and his Third
Assistant or, in his anxiety to curb the circulation growth of periodicals,
<i>did he forget</i> what he and Mr. Britt had said?</p>

<p>What’s the answer?</p>

<p>I give it up. However it may appear to the reader, to The Man
on the Ladder it appears that Mr. Hitchcock in his 1910 report has
written, figured and “recommended” himself into a situation that is
far more humoresque than it is consistent or informative.</p>

<p>Returning to the report of the 1906-7 commission, I will
mention a few more of its objectionable recommendations.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the Penrose-Overstreet Commission recommended
the enactment of a law requiring that newspapers and other
periodicals devote not more than one-half their space to advertising
matter (Section 3 of recommended bill, page 50 of report). Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in pressing an ill-conceived purpose to restrain the growth of circulation
and increase of weight of monthly and weekly periodicals, they
would, it appears, cut into that division of their published matter
<i>which produces the greatest revenue to the government for carriage and
handling</i>.</p>

<p>The truth of the last clause preceding has been so frequently and
conclusively shown as to require no argument to convince the veriest
tyro in knowledge of federal postoffice affairs and the sources of its
revenues that the statement made is true. Elsewhere in this volume,
however, the truth of the statement will be found fully established.</p>

<p>I confine the application of the statement to monthly and weekly
periodicals, to such as are of general circulation. It of course applies,
but in lesser degree, to newspapers. The advertising matter published
in the newspapers is largely of local character, while that
published in our high class monthly magazines and weeklies, in trade
journals, etc., is largely general in character. The advertisements
published by the former are chiefly those of local merchants and
manufacturers and of local, commercial, financial and other interests.
On the other hand the advertisements carried by the class of monthly
and weekly periodicals indicated represent persons, companies and
interests widely scattered throughout the country. Because of this
phase in the character of the advertisements carried, the newspapers
advertising space is not nearly so large a contributor to the government’s
revenues from first, third and fourth class mail carriage and
handling as is the advertising space of our high-class monthly and
weekly periodicals.</p>

<p>It is true that this 1906-7 commission makes a somewhat <i>strained</i>
effort to assign two chief reasons for its recommendation to curtail
the space which publishers of periodicals of all kinds may devote to
advertising matter.</p>

<p>1. The commissioners appear to have been carrying around with
them a stern purpose to suppress what they designate as the “mail
order” publications, devoted largely to advertising the wares carried
in stock by one or, at most, a few firms that individually or jointly
pay for publishing the “weekly” or “monthly”, as the case may be.</p>

<p>There can be no question that there is a large number of such
alleged periodicals which have been issued and distributed through the
mails for the <i>plainly</i> manifest purpose of advertising the merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of those who pay for publishing them. I believe, however, that there
are fewer of such fake periodicals enjoying the mail service at second-class
rates today than there were ten or fifteen years ago. The Postoffice
Department, it must be said to its credit, has “disciplined” a
large number of them out of existence or, at any rate, out of the
second-class mail rate privilege.</p>

<p>But even if there are more of such fraud and fake periodicals
today than formerly, any fair-minded man must agree that it is a very
rank injustice to punish&mdash;to penalize by harsh restrictions and increased
mailing rates&mdash;the thousands of legitimate and highly serviceable
periodicals for the sins of a comparatively few alleged publications
which have abused or are abusing the second-class mail rate privilege.</p>

<p>The department, with its large force of inspectors and investigators,
should be able to weed out and exclude such “fixed” periodicals.
If it cannot do so it appears to The Man on the Ladder that
it would not require a very large amount of industrious, strenuous
thinking on the part of six robust, competent legislators to frame a
law that would reach the <i>guilty</i> without punishing or crippling the
innocent.</p>

<p>2. This commission was also, it would appear, a stickler over
<i>compliance</i> with the postal statutes&mdash;statutes (those now largely
governing) enacted in 1879 and 1885, therefore so antiquated in their
wording in several particulars as to be a misfit when attempt is made
to apply them to the vast business and varied character of periodicals
today.</p>

<p>The statute of March 3, 1879, in its definition of what the law
would recognize as a periodical says, among other things, that a
periodical must be “<i>originated and published for the dissemination of
information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the arts,
sciences, or to some industry</i>.”</p>

<p>This portion of the statutory definition the Commission seems to
have entertained a special grudge against. At any rate it expatiated
at considerable length in its report, against the inadequacy, lack of
definiteness, etc., of the definition as given. The commission’s
chief objection seems to center around the fact that space in periodicals
should not be devoted to “commercial ends.”</p>

<p>On page 35 of the report the commission says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“What was in the mind of the author (of the 1879 statute), is clear enough.
He wished to prohibit the misuse of the privileges for <i>commercial ends</i> as distinguished
from the devotion to literature, science, and the rest.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is possible that they knew what was in the mind of the author
of that ’79 statute better than I know it, or than Jim Smith or Reuben
Peachtree knows it. It is also possible that they did <i>not</i> know the
mind of that lawbuilder any better. While the ’79 statute does
not, in many particulars, meet present conditions as they should be
met, in defining a publication that should be recognized as a periodical,
it requires a supercritical or finicky mind to find much fault
with it.</p>

<p>A periodical must be “originated and published for the dissemination
of <i>information</i> of a public character, devoted to <i>literature</i>, the
<i>arts</i>, sciences or some <i>special industry</i>.”</p>

<p>Now, when one considers the broad application of the word
“literature,” the word “arts,” comprehending as it does not only the
mechanical and liberal or polite arts, but also <i>business</i>, commercial,
mercantile and others, including the science of business management,
and the term “special industry” and the broad field covered by
it&mdash;when one considers the broad application of those words, it is a
fairly legitimate inference that it was “in the mind” of the writer
when drafting that ’79 statute <i>to give a broad meaning</i> and range of
service to the publications he intended should be classed as periodicals.</p>

<p>In this connection it is pertinent to ask why periodical publications
should not serve, either in their advertising pages or in their
“body pages,” devoted to fiction and articles on political conditions,
economics, history, the lives and deeds of men, forests and forestry,
mills, mines, factory, farm and a vast array of other features, phases
and conditions&mdash;why, I ask, should our periodicals not give aid by
giving space to the great mercantile, manufacturing, financial, agricultural
and other interests in this country&mdash;<i>interests which, collectively,
have built up a commerce more vast today than that of any
other nation of earth</i>?</p>

<p>Why should not this vast commerce of ours&mdash;a commerce in
which every man, woman and child of our people is directly or indirectly
interested&mdash;be aided and served in every legitimate way
by our periodicals? Will some <i>politically</i> living member of that
Penrose-Overstreet Commission rise and answer? Answer, not in
hypercritical nothings, but <i>straightly and bluntly</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Another immediately pertinent thing should be stated and
another asked here. Among the instruments which have contributed
to build up the great commerce of the nation, the American periodical
must be recognized&mdash;<i>is recognized</i>&mdash;as one of the most efficient.</p>

<p>Why, then, this recent attempt to cripple, to curb, to lessen, its
influence and effort? And why, again, try to curtail its circulation
and usefulness by prattle about a postal “deficit” as reason for
restrictive departmental rulings and laws when, should such restrictive
measures be made effective, a shrinkage of postal revenues and a
consequent increase of deficit would, necessarily, result?</p>

<p>Will some one whose thought-dome and <i>pockets</i> are not full of
ulterior motives and postal service “deficits” please rise and answer?</p>

<p>Returning to the 1906-7 commission’s agony over the definition
in the act of 1879 of what should be considered a periodical and,
therefore, entitled to mail entry as second-class matter, it appears
that the commissioners, in an apparent <i>anxious</i> anxiety to prove
their charge against the author of the act for careless, ambiguous
wording, quote a lawyer’s opinion, or part of such opinion, in support
of the carefully framed-up “arguments” which it presents in didactic
order, both before and after the quotation.</p>

<p>The quotation, it should be noted, is from the brief of the Postmaster
General’s counsel in Houghton vs. Payne, 194 U. S. 88, or so
the commission’s report designates it.</p>

<p>The point of the commission’s argument appears to be: (1) that
owing to its loose, indefinite wording, the act of ’79 was of easy evasion
when it came to passing upon the kind and character of matter which
might be published in periodical form and mailed at second-class
rates, and (2) that, by reason of such loose and indefinite wording,
periodical publishers <i>have</i> evaded the intent and purpose of the act&mdash;have
abused their second-class rate privileges&mdash;<i>have violated the law</i>.</p>

<p>That, at any rate, I read as the point and purpose of the commission’s
somewhat labored, if not strained, argument. They quote
(pages 37-38) this counsel in support of that argument. I shall
here reprint that quotation as evidence that the publisher of “the
universally recognized, commonly accepted, and perfectly well
understood periodical of everyday speech” (see fifth paragraph of
quotation) <i>have not violated the law nor sought to do so</i>.</p>

<p>The quoted opinion presents some italicized words, phrases and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
clauses as it appears in the report. I have taken the liberty to
further italicize in reprinting it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The next words only strengthen the same idea&mdash;originated and published
<i>for the dissemination of information of a public character</i>. Not, it will be observed,
that it shall <i>contain</i> information of a public character, but shall be published <i>for
the dissemination of</i> such public information. Each of these words is significant,
and each gathers significance from its neighbors. <i>Dissemination</i> is here a word
of strong color and tinges all the rest. It indicates a dynamic process, an agency
at work carrying out a purpose for which it was originated and set in motion.
But strong as the word dissemination is, it is fortified by the use of the word
<i>information</i>. An agency for the dissemination of knowledge for example, might
better consist with the idea of a library of books. But the word is not knowledge,
but <i>information</i>. The distinction is obvious. One has the sense of accumulated
stores; the other of <i>imparting the idea of things for current needs</i>. One is, as it
were, human experience at rest; the other, human experience in action. One may
be as stale as you please; the other must be new, fresh, vital. A book, a volume,
is the medium of one; a journal the medium of the other.</p>

<p>“Information,” says the Century Dictionary, “is timely or specific knowledge
respecting some <i>matter of interest or inquiry</i>.” It is, as it were, vitalized knowledge;
knowledge imbued with life and activity. Nor when we come to the next
phase do we find any change in the idea&mdash;or devoted to literature, the sciences,
arts, or some special industry. <i>Devoted</i> to literature. Mark you, not that the
publication shall be literature or contain literature, but that it shall be devoted
to literature. What is meant by devoted? The Century Dictionary puts it
thus: To direct or apply chiefly or wholly to some purpose, work, or use; to give
or surrender completely, as to some person or end, as to <i>devote</i> oneself to art,
literature, or philanthropy. There again we have the idea of a permanent continuing
entity, a thing existing for a given purpose, appearing regularly at such
intervals (not greater than three months), as may most effectually meet its needs,
in the interest of art, of science, or literature.</p>

<p>Do we say that a book&mdash;a novel, a history, a drama&mdash;is devoted to literature?
It is not devoted to literature; <i>it is literature</i>, and it would be an absurdity
to speak of it as devoted to itself. Such a locution would be merely a willful
perversion of language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a review or a magazine may be said to be devoted to
literature with perfect naturalness and propriety. For we rightly conceive of
the review or magazine as one definite recognizable entity&mdash;a continuing whole,
originated for a given purpose, and made up of similar parts having a common
object&mdash;literature, for example, or art, or science, or whatever else it is to which
the whole is devoted.</p>

<p>Taking these words, originated and published for, dissemination, information,
devoted to, they all point to one conclusion. They are, we repeat, strong and
pregnant words. There is but one concept consistent with them all. We
confidently submit that an attentive reading of the statute will leave no doubt
that what Congress constantly had in mind in the creating of this privileged class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of publications was the <i>universally recognized, commonly accepted, and perfectly
well understood periodical of everyday speech</i>.</p>

<p>In establishing the rate for newspapers and other periodical publications
Congress was not seeking to discriminate between good literature and bad
literature or to establish a <i>censorship of the press with prizes for merit</i>. The thing it
had in mind was not the goodness or badness of the information disseminated, but
the <i>instrumentalities by which that dissemination might be accomplished</i>. It was
not thinking of all the accumulated stores of sound and pure literature in the vast
libraries of the world, <i>but it was thinking of how the mind of an inquiring and
progressive people might be kept abreast of the times in all departments of human
thought and activity</i>. Congress did not stand hesitating between a good book and
a bad newspaper.</p>

</div>

<p>Another position taken by the Penrose-Overstreet Commission,
and one which The Man on the Ladder strongly opposes, is that a
periodical may not or “must not consist wholly or substantially of
fiction.”</p>

<p>The words just quoted are exactly the words used in the sixth
paragraph of Section 2 of the bill the enactment of which this commission
recommended.</p>

<p>Now, whatever their wit or wisdom, their eloquence or adroitness
of speech, their beauty of shape and apparel, or their loftiness of
position, that “recommendation” should recommend the personnel
of that commission, it seems to me, to some “wronghouse” for a long
rest. Their conclusion, their <i>lex</i> recommendation and their “argument”
in support, taken collectively, are as thrilling, likewise amusing,
as the point in a story “where the woman is turned on and begins to
short circuit the hero,” putting it as near as I can remember in the
language of Sewell Ford, Bowers, or some other “enlivening writer.”</p>

<p>Lest the reader think my adverse criticism of the commissioners
too harsh, or not in keeping with the dignity of the gentlemen
composing that 1906-7 commission, I shall here quote a few of the
paragraphs it presents as basis for its recommendation. The reader
will oblige by carefully noting the italics. They are mine, and, following
the quotation, I shall comment on some of those italicized
phrasings and statements:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not only does the element of fiction constitute the (1) <i>propulsive force behind
the expansion of second-class matter</i>, but it serves at the same time (2) <i>to undermine
the main statutory check upon the commercial exploitation of the second class</i>. Being
free to make up a periodical which contains nothing but fiction, publishers find
ready at hand the very thing with which to interlard and <i>disguise the advertising
matter</i>, for the sake of which the publication is really issued. This they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
could not do if the advertisement carrying text was required to be news matter or
critical matter of a current nature. (3) <i>Deprive the mail-order journals of the
right to cloak</i> their advertising with fiction and require them to publish something
in the nature of a newspaper or review with expensive news-gathering apparatus
and an editorial staff and (4) the <i>mail-order advertising journal will completely
disappear</i>. It lives only by reason of two things, the cheapness of its fiction, with
which it cloaks its advertising, and the cheapness of the postal rate which that
fiction cloak enables it to obtain.</p>

<p>“The distinction between the fiction-carrying periodical and the nonfiction-carrying
periodical (5) <i>is precisely the distinction between a periodical fulfilling
the purposes of the act and the publication which, although periodical in its form, has
no true periodicity in its essence</i>.</p>

<p>“Another consequence of the expansive power of fiction is found in the confusion
of the newspaper and magazine types and the unhealthy exaggeration of the
modern newspaper, as shown especially in its Sunday editions.</p>

<p>“The newspaper is rapidly being extended into the magazine field at the
sacrifice both of the postal revenue and the (6) <i>true mission of the newspaper. The
miscellaneous matter contained in the Sunday issue of a newspaper must of necessity
lack the quality to make it socially and educationally valuable.</i>” (Page 37.)</p>

<p>“No fiction necessarily involves the element of periodicity or time publication
which is involved in the very idea of a newspaper or periodical. It follows,
then, (7) <i>that the real purpose of the act of March 3, 1879, namely, the diffusion in
the quickest possible way at the smallest possible cost of timely information among
the people, is perverted when the right to that quick and inexpensive diffusion is
extended to the form of fiction</i>. But the periodical form devoted to fiction, or in
which fiction constitutes the predominant feature, is the very form of periodical
which serves to swell the second class. The popular demand for fiction seems to
be practically unlimited. The temptation offered by the low postal rate to supply
that demand through the periodical form is a temptation impossible to resist.”
(Page 39.)</p>

</div>

<p>I shall make my comment on the foregoing in the order that its
italicized <i>assertions</i> are numbered.</p>

<p>(1) The “element of fiction” has not and does <i>not</i> constitute
“the propulsive force” stated. Was it “fiction” that propulsed the
circulation of <i>Everybody’s</i>? of <i>Pearson’s</i>? of <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>? of <i>The
American</i>? of <i>McClure’s</i>? of <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>? of <i>The Inland
Printer</i>? of <i>The Progressive Printer</i>? or of scores of other monthly
and weekly periodicals whose publishers are independent enough to
do their own thinking and courageous enough to publish what they
and their representatives found to be the truth?</p>

<p>Was “Frenzied Finance” fiction?</p>

<p>Was Anna M. Tarbell’s exposures of Standard Oil fiction?</p>

<p>Was the exposure of the Waters-Pierce Oil Company’s connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with the great Senatorial “I” of Texas fiction? Was the shake-up of
the “Big Three” life insurance companies fiction? Were the hundreds
of other trenchant write-ups and exposures of wrong practices, of
impositions, of crookedness and <i>crooks</i> in official, corporation and
private life, “fiction?”</p>

<p>The man who reads and will attempt to answer any of those
questions affirmatively needs to have his brain dusted up&mdash;that is, of
course, on the presumption that he is not <i>paid for vocal gyrations</i>.</p>

<p>And yet it was the telling write-ups and exposures of these
independents which greatly increased their circulation and, consequently,
increased second-class tonnage.</p>

<p>(2) There is no such “main statutory check.” Moreover, the
“commercial exploitation” given in the advertising pages of our
standard periodicals to merchants, manufacturers, etc., is, as previously
shown, not only just and due to the vast commercial interests of
the country, but it is safely within both the letter and the intent of
the statute.</p>

<p>(3) As previously intimated, a sextet of experienced legislators
who could not frame up a law that would put the “mail-order journals”
and other abusers and abuses of the second-class mail-rate
privilege out of business without ruinously restricting and obstructing
the vast legitimate periodical interests of the country, that sextet
ought to do one of two things, either send their thought equipment
to a vacuum cleaner to get the dust blown off and then try again, or
they should turn the task over to some other legislators. There most
certainly are scores of legislators in the Senate and the House fully
equipped to prepare such a piece of legislation.</p>

<p>(4) In comment under (3) I noted this “mail order advertising
journal.” I did so to indicate that the Penrose-Overstreet Commission,
as it appears to me, worked the “mail order” print stuff
overtime for the purpose of <i>reaching certain legitimate publications</i>.</p>

<p>(5) There is no such distinction between “a fiction-carrying periodical
and the non-fiction carrying periodical” as that named. Fiction
in a periodical is just as permissible under the act as is the series
of war stories, or reminiscences, now (May, 1911), running in one of the
magazines; as in the series of articles on the civil war now running in
one of the Chicago newspapers, or as would be a series of articles on
“the Panama Canal,” on the “Development of the Reaping Machine,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
on “Treason in Our Senate,” on “The Depletion of American Forests,”
on “The Railroads’ Side of the Railway Mail Pay,” or on any other
subject of the historical past or active present.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the current fiction, whether in serial or short-story,
published in the standard monthly, weekly and other periodicals
of large general circulation presents far more of <i>truth</i> than do the
stories, reminiscences and “historical narratives about the civil war,”
written forty-five years after the events, and, if based on personal
experience, written from fading memory of the facts.</p>

<p>(6) While one may agree with the thought expressed by the
commission at (6), its wording expresses a desire or tendency to
<i>censor</i> the periodical press of the people by legislative restrictions and
departmental rulings which not only contravene the Federal Constitution,
but which are inimical to the personal rights and liberties guaranteed
by that constitution.</p>

<p>Force is added to this objection to the commission’s recommendation
by the fact that it specifically delegates to the Postmaster General
the power and authority to decide the kind and character of printed
matter which shall have the right of entry at second-class rates, and
which complies with the requirements the commission would have
written into the law.</p>

<p>Section 2 of the at present governing statute, the commission
advised (see recommended bill, page 49 of report), should, in its opening
paragraph, read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“No newspaper or other periodical shall be admitted to the second
class unless it shall be made to appear by evidence, <i>satisfactory to the
Postmaster General or his lawful deputy in that behalf</i>, that it complies
with the following conditions.”</p>

<p>Then follow the “conditions,” several of which I have already
shown to be seriously objectionable.</p>

<p>(7) I have already presented, under (5), some objections to the
commission’s argument made in this seventh citation. I will, however,
again say that the publication of fiction, other than immoral, in
periodicals, does not, in my judgment at least, in any way infringe
the “purpose of the act” of 1879. I will here go further, and say that
the act of ’79 does <i>not</i> comprehend in its “real purpose,” as the
commission tries to make it appear at (7), that “the diffusion in the
quickest possible way at the smallest possible cost of <i>timely</i> information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
among the people”&mdash;that is, the act does not so purpose if the
word “timely,” as here used, is intended to mean “news” or “currence
of matter,” etc., as the commission elsewhere in its report argues for.
In fact, the commission’s statement at (7) is further alee of the “real
purpose” of the act of 1879 than is the publication of <i>any fiction</i> in a
periodical, and that too, whether the fiction be a reprint of some old
production or the imaginative visualizations of some current writer
who moved from periodical publication in 1908 or 1909 to print as a
“best-seller” in 1910, or from a best seller in 1908-9 to periodical
form in 1911.</p>

<p>In short, the commission’s position regarding the publication of
fiction in periodical form contravenes the “real purpose” of the law.
So, also, does its position on several points it seeks to bolster in its
report contravene the real purpose of that act, as I have previously
shown, quoting in one instance the opinion of a Postmaster General’s
counsel, which opinion the commission itself quoted to support a
<i>false position</i>.</p>

<p>I feel constrained to make another point against the stand this
commission took against the admissibility to the second class mail
rate privilege of periodicals largely devoted to fiction.</p>

<p>It appears to me that these commissioners must have confined
their reading in recent years largely to the older and so-called “classic”
fiction, to professional tomes, to juridic opinions, attorney’s briefs,
and to “booster” stuff for parties and candidates published in our
newspapers. Certainly they could not have read much of the
periodical fiction published by our high-class monthlies and weeklies.
If they had done so, they would not, it seems to me, have written so
loosely and <i>unwarrantedly</i> of the “fiction” in their report.</p>

<p>Had they read much of the fiction appearing in the leading
periodicals during current and recent years, they would have learned
at least two facts about it:</p>

<p>1. Much&mdash;yes, most&mdash;of the fiction printed during recent years
in our standard periodicals (even in those printing only fiction as
“body matter”), has been highly didactic or educational in character.</p>

<p>2. The periodical fiction published in our leading magazines and
weeklies has taught our people lessons in morals, in politics, in political
economy, in social, domestic and industrial life. It has told its readers
of the habits and habitat of animals, of birds and bees; of flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of fruits and forestry. Nor has there been much of “nature faking”
in it. Some of the most informative matter ever printed bearing
upon natural history, the geography, topography and hydrography
of this earth, has reached us through the periodical fiction
of the past ten or twelve years. Not only that, but such fiction has
gone to the farm and into the laboratory, into the mine, the factory,
the mill, and the lumber camp; into the mercantile establishment,
into transportation, both rail and water; into the counting room, into
the “sweat-shop” and into the tenement districts, the purlieus and
the “submerged tenths” in both the lower and higher “walks” of the
world’s various and varying civilizations, and it has <i>taught us things</i>
we did not before know.</p>

<p>Then <i>why</i> should new laws be enacted, or old laws be twisted,
turned or misconstrued, to exclude “fiction”&mdash;<i>periodical</i> fiction&mdash;from
the second-class mail rate privilege?</p>

<p>One other objection I find to this 1906-7 commission’s report.
It recommends the appointment of a “Commission of Postal Appeals.”</p>

<p>The report states that certain publishers favored such a commission.
That be as it may, I do not believe that such a commission
will return service value at all commensurate with the amount of
public money it would cost to keep its wheels “greased” and operating.
Next to a bureaucracy, government by commissions is the
worst. Can the reader think of a “Commission”&mdash;a Government, a
State, County or City Commission&mdash;that ever discharged, promptly
and satisfactorily, the duties assigned to it? One is put to no trouble
to think of scores of Civil Service Commissions, Forestry Commissions,
Subway Commissions, Canal Commissions, Traction Commissions,
Railroad Commissions, Postal Commissions, Inter-State Commerce
Commissions and a host of others.</p>

<p>But do you know of one of them that ever did any real serviceable
work <i>for the people</i>&mdash;did it until an aroused and hostile public opinion
<i>kicked</i> it into doing the work?</p>

<p>You may know of one. The Man on the Ladder knows of <i>none</i>,
and he has been watching the service value of the “commission” for
thirty-five years. As a <i>governing</i> instrument it has largely been a
<i>subversive</i> instrument. It always spends its appropriation. It
always puts as many of its uncles, brothers and nephews on the pay
roll and takes as many junkets as is possible under its appropriation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and, if the appropriation is exceeded, it usually asks for more and&mdash;<i>gets
it</i>.</p>

<p>We have an Interstate Commerce Commission. It has been on
the job ever since John Sherman put it on duty. Sherman knew
what he intended&mdash;<i>wanted</i>&mdash;it to do. Did it do what he and the rest
of us depended on it to do? Well, not to any noticeable extent. It
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of our money while it <i>permitted</i>
the railroads and express companies to rebate, “differential”
and “short” and “long” haul us out <i>of hundreds of millions of easy
or stolen dollars</i>.</p>

<p>O yes! of course the Interstate Commerce Commission is, of late,
getting down to business&mdash;getting down to the work John Sherman
<i>intended it to do when he drafted the bill which created it</i>.</p>

<p>Why has that commission finally arrived at its starting point?
Why is it now trying to do&mdash;and trying, even yet, to do it in a
<i>loose, dilatory way</i>&mdash;what Sherman intended it to do?</p>

<p>“Why?” Why, simply because the people have finally learned&mdash;thanks
largely to the enlightenment given them by the independent
periodicals of the country&mdash;that they have been governmentally
treated as fools&mdash;that they have been treated as sheep to furnish
fleece and mutton for a few who feast and wear fine raiment, <i>yet earn
it not</i>.</p>

<p>O yes, the people have learned some things and they, recently,
have been learning rapidly. It is the people who have <i>learned</i> who
have virtually <i>kicked</i> the Interstate Commerce Commission into
dutiful action.</p>

<p>No, I positively do not like government by commission, and
especially do I not like government of our postal service, or any
phase, feature or division of it, by a “Commission of Postal Appeals”
or by any other commission, however dignified its title may be. Any
suggestion or recommendation of such a commission is, to The Man
on the Ladder, but a suggestion and recommendation to further load
an already <i>overloaded</i> service.</p>

<p>By that, I mean that the service now rendered by the Federal
Postoffice Department is not nearly commensurate with the number
of employes carried on its payrolls or with its expenditures, and that
the creation of a commission&mdash;any postal commission&mdash;will only add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
names to the department payrolls and thousands of dollars to its
already excessive expenditures.</p>

<p>In closing my consideration of this Penrose-Overstreet Commission’s
report&mdash;a report which Mr. Hitchcock appears to have taken
some “hunches” from while it also appears he gave very little or no
study or consideration to the vast amount of informative data it
collected and <i>filed</i>&mdash;I desire to make a statement or two and then ask
a pertinently impertinent question or two.</p>

<p>Among the vast amount of informative data on the subject of
transporting and handling second-class mail matter, its cost to the
government, etc., there are pages upon pages of testimony by publishers
the commission invited to appear before it in person or by representative.
Some of that testimony, so newspapers reported during
the hearings in both New York and Washington, is supported or re-enforced
by the jurats of the publishers testifying. Some of those
publishers stated in their testimony that the sample copies they had
distributed had, by reason of the correspondence and mail business
resulting, amply compensated the government for carrying and handling
such sample copies. Several <i>specific and detailed</i> statements
were made by the publishers.</p>

<p>Again: The publishers furnished voluminous testimony&mdash;both
in their own statements and in the correspondence of business men
who had patronized the columns of their publications&mdash;in proof of the
fact that (1) the advertising pages of their publications were as generally
read, if not more read, than were the body pages, and (2) that
the sales of stamps by the government for the correspondence and
business resulting from the advertisements printed yielded far more
postal revenue than did any other character of second-class matter
the mail service handled.</p>

<p>Now, the questions.</p>

<p>When this Penrose-Overstreet Commission sent out its invitations
most of them went to publishers and associations of publishers.
At any rate so it would appear from statements in the commission’s
report.</p>

<p><i>Did the commission believe the publishers invited were liars?</i></p>

<p>If so, why did it invite them?</p>

<p>After hearing their verbal testimony and looking over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
written statements, <i>did the commission conclude that those publishers
were liars</i>?</p>

<p>If so, why did it spend the people’s money to collate, digest and
file the testimony of liars for the information of Mr. Cortelyou, the
then Postmaster General, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Hitchcock, his successor,
and other Postmaster Generals who will follow Mr. Hitchcock?</p>

<p>Again&mdash;If those commissioners of 1906-7 concluded, either before
or after hearing them, that the publishers were or are <i>liars</i>, why may
not, or should not, those publishers conclude (after reading their
report) that the commissioners are liars?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PUBLISHERS SPEAK.</span></h2>

<p>I quoted from Senator Owen on a previous page when discussing
the unconstitutionality of Senate revenue-originating amendments.
Under his leave to print Senator Owen embodied in his remarks on
February 25, 1911, the arguments presented by some of the publishers
in reply to Mr. Hitchcock’s statements. They point out in particular
his peculiar method of figuring by which he reaches results so at
variance with the facts as, at times, to be far more amusing than
informative. I shall here quote some of them.</p>

<p>I have previously adverted to the promptitude of Senators
Owen, Bristow, Bourne, Cummings and others in getting onto the
firing line. Their combined resistance soon forced Mr. Hitchcock
to unmask his guns. He was ready, it would seem, to do or concede
almost anything <i>provided</i>, always and of course, he could give a few
of those pestiferous, independent magazines a jar that would so agitate
their several bank accounts as to influence them to print what they
were <i>told</i> to print.</p>

<p>But when the General found that he was flanked, and his position
being shot up, he began to display parley and peace signals. “The
country newspapers would not be affected”&mdash;they would still be
carried and distributed free&mdash;55,000,000 pounds of them or more
each and every calendar year.</p>

<p>The “poor farmer” needs special government aid, you know. Or,
if the farmer should not be personally in need of government assistance,
as now it frequently and numerously chances, why, well&mdash;oh, well, we
desire to show our friendly “leanin’s toward him.” He may remember
it at the next Presidential election&mdash;just when we may be needing
a few farmer votes. So, as one evidence of our kindly consideration
for the farmer, we will not trench upon his <i>special privilege</i>. He shall
still have delivered him&mdash;free&mdash;fifty-five to seventy million pounds of
“patent insides” and other partisan dope sheets, printed in his own
county and published and edited by regularly indentured, branded
and tagged political fence-builders&mdash;guaranteed “safe” under the
pure food laws, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Postmaster General Hitchcock also let it be generally
known that it was remote from his intentions to add a mail-rate
penalty to any religious, educational, fraternal or scientific periodical.
Some of these&mdash;not including the Sunday School leaflets, of course&mdash;circulate
in vast editions ranging from 500 to 5,000 copies a month.
They, too, were such “powerful educational instruments,” he or some
of his assistants assured doubting Thomases in both the upper and
the lower branches of federal legislation.</p>

<p>Next, he back-stepped a little to assure trade journals that it
was not his purpose to hand them any advance over the cent-a-pound
mail rate, or so at least, Washington correspondents reported. Finally
it is said, a statement generously borne out by the wording of his
jockeyed “rider,” that newspapers&mdash;<i>all newspapers</i>&mdash;would be fanned
through the mail service at the old cent-a-pound rate.</p>

<p>It would appear that the anxious interest of our Postmaster
General was willing to let almost any old thing in the shape of a
“periodical” switch through and along at the old rate, if he could only
ham-string a few&mdash;a score or less&mdash;of monthly and weekly periodicals
which persisted in printing the unlaundered truth about looters,
both in and out of office.</p>

<p>Now, we will present a few figures and statements of the publishers,
presented in answer to Mr. Hitchcock’s voluminous, likewise
varied and variegated, utterances, both verbal and in print, to support
his <i>lurid guess</i> that it costs the government 9.23 cents a pound to
transport and handle second-class mail matter.</p>

<p>Before quoting the publishers, however, I desire to say two
things:</p>

<p>1. The periodical publishers must necessarily know, I take it,
more about the business of printing and distributing periodicals than
Mr. Hitchcock has been able to learn about that business in the two
<i>politically swift</i> years he has been on his present job.</p>

<p>2. The publishers in replying&mdash;<i>in presenting the facts</i>&mdash;are
entirely too dignified. Of course, dignity is a fine thing&mdash;an elegant
decoration for our advanced and super-polished civilization. But
when some human animal deliberately and industriously tries to
shunt on to your siding a carload or more of “deficits” and other
partisan and “vested interest” junk, and tells you its price is so much
and <i>that you have to pay the price</i>&mdash;well, at about that point in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
progress of our splendid civilization, I think it both the part of justice
and of thrift to lay <i>dignity</i> on the parlor couch and walk out on your
own trackage, making as you loiter along a few plain and easily understood
remarks. That is just what I believe these publishers should
have done when Mr. Hitchcock covertly tried to deliver to them,
charges collect, his several large consignments of talk about “deficits,”
“cost of carriage and handling second-class matter,” “publisher’s
profits” and other subjects about which he was either equally ill-informed
or ill-advised.</p>

<p>Yes, there are occasions when it is quite proper to hang one’s
dignity on that nail behind the kitchen door and sally forth in shirt
sleeves with top-piece full of rapid-fire conversation.</p>

<p>With these suggestions, from which it is hoped the publishers
may take a few hints for future guidance when Presidents and Postmaster
Generals undertake to deliver to them a cargo of cold-storage
stuff that was “off color” before it left the farm, I will proceed to do
what I have several times started to do&mdash;quote the publisher on Mr.
Hitchcock’s ring-around-a-rosy method of figuring.</p>

<p>In quoting from the publishers’ “exhibits” it is due to Senator
Owen that we reprint a few paragraphs from his foreword. In speaking
to “the merits of the case,” the Senator said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Separate and apart from the fact that this proposed amendment violates the
Constitution of the United States and the rules of the Senate, I regard such method
of legislation as unwise, if not reprehensible, for the reason that, in effect, it is a
denial of the right to be heard by those who are deeply interested in it. Over a
year ago the periodical publishers affected desired to be heard in this matter, and
were not given a proper hearing on this vital question. Indeed, they appear to
have been left under the impression that nothing would be done in regard to the
matter; or, at all events, they seem to have been under this impression. When
the matter came before the House of Representatives and the committee having
the matter in charge, no discussion of this matter took place. No report on it was
made. No opportunity to be heard was afforded. Neither was the matter
discussed on the floor of the House. When the postoffice appropriation bill
came to the Senate, <i>no hearing was afforded, but at the last minute</i>, after the
committee had practically concluded every item on the appropriation bill, this
item was presented, not only giving the periodical publishers no opportunity to
be heard, but giving the members of the committee no opportunity to study this
matter and to digest it. I regard it as grossly unfair, and at the time in the
committee I reserved the right to oppose this amendment on the floor of the Senate.</p>

<p><i>In the affairs affecting our internal administration I am strongly opposed to
any secrecy.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>In my judgment, the claim made by the Postoffice Department <i>is erroneous
on its face</i>, for the obvious reason that it is conceded that these magazines are
brought by express and distributed in Washington, D. C., over 250 miles from
New York, at less than 1 cent a pound for cost of transportation and distribution.
The Postoffice Department declares that it costs 9 cents a pound. <i>This is a
mere juggling of figures.</i></p>

<p>I have no doubt that if a proper weighing of the mails was observed, and if
the railways were to carry the mails at a reasonable rate, this distribution could
be made at a cost approximately <i>that which I have named</i>, as illustrated by the
cost of distribution in Washington City, which is an undisputed fact.</p>

</div>

<p>After presenting the publishers’ “Exhibit A,” in which they
refute Mr. Hitchcock’s unfounded assertions of colossal profits in the
magazine publishing business&mdash;a subject which I treat elsewhere&mdash;the
Senator presents their “Exhibit B,” which counters the Postmaster
General’s claim that the proposed increase in rate would yield a large
revenue to the government. “Exhibit B” reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It has been shown from the original books of account of the five most prominent
magazines that the proposed measure charging 4 cents a pound postage
on all sheets of magazines on which advertising is printed would tax these magazines,
the most powerful group, best able to meet such a shock, nearly the whole
of their entire net income. This means that the new postal rate could not
be paid. There is not money enough in the magazine business to pay it. Magazines
would simply be debarred from the United States mails.</p>

<p>But assume, for the sake of argument, that this would not be the case, and
that the money could be found to pay the new postage bills, what, theoretically,
would be the increased revenue of the Postoffice Department, for the sake of
which it is proposed to take more than all the profits of the industry that has been
built up since 1879?</p>

<p>The Postmaster General, in his statement given to the Associated Press, and
published in the newspapers Tuesday morning, February 14, claims that the
proposed postal increase on periodical advertising would amount to less than
1 cent flat on the weight of the whole periodical. This is not the way the ambiguously
worded amendment works out literally; but, accepting the Postmaster
General’s figures and applying them to the weights, given in his annual report,
of the second-class mail classifications affected by the increase, let us pin the
Postoffice Department down to what it hopes to gain from a measure that would
confiscate the earnings of an industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock in his statement gives 800,000,000 pounds as the total weight
of second-class matter. In his report for 1909 he gives the percentage of this
weight of the classifications that could possibly be affected by this proposed
increase as 20.23 per cent for magazines, 6.4 per cent for educational publications,
5.91 per cent for religious periodicals, 4.94 per cent for trade journals,
and 5 per cent for agricultural periodicals, making 42.97 per cent altogether of
the 800,000,000 pounds that might be affected by the proposed increase, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
343,760,000 pounds. Of course, this includes the periodicals publishing less than 4,000
pounds weight per issue, and exempted by the amendment.</p>

<p>But, making no deduction whatsoever for these exemptions, and none for the
great expense of administering this complex measure, with its effect of conferring
despotic power, certain to be disputed, the Postmaster General claims
that this figures out only 1 cent increased revenue on 343,760,000 pounds, or
a gross theoretical gain to the Postoffice Department of $3,437,600. These are
the Postmaster General’s figures, not the publishers’.</p>

<p>But from this figure of 343,760,000 pounds the Postmaster General would
have to subtract the weight of all the periodicals exempted, and also subtract
all the new expense involved for a large force of clerks.</p>

<p>There will also be a great increase of work for inspectors, as the proposed
measure puts a premium on dishonesty. There will be constant temptation for
unscrupulous people, who try to take the place of the present reputable publishers,
to publish advertising in the guise of legitimate reading matter. There
will be extra legal expenses for the disputes that arise between publishers and
the Postoffice Department over matters in which the publishers may believe
the department is using the despotic power given by this measure to confiscate
the property of publishers. In the hearings before the Weeks committee,
it was frankly admitted by members of the House Committee on Postoffices
and Postroads that the government postoffice service could never be run with the
economy and efficiency of a private concern.</p>

<p>With all the expense of this new scheme subtracted from such a small possible
gain as is claimed by Mr. Hitchcock, what revenue would remain to justify
the wiping out of an industry built up in good faith through thirty-two years of
an established fundamental postoffice rate?</p>

<p>If the department succeeded in saving $2,000,000, after deducting the
exempted publications and all the new expense involved for a great force of clerks,
this would amount to less than 1 per cent of its revenues for 1910. It would
amount to less than one-eighth of the postoffice deficit in 1909. It would amount
to less than one-fourteenth of the loss on rural free delivery alone in that year.</p>

<p>But even this gain would be only theoretical; for, as shown before (Exhibit
A), many of the comparatively small groups of periodicals left to be published,
after the favored ones were exempted, would find that it required more than all
their income to pay their share of the new rate.</p>

<p>You can not take away from a person more than 100 per cent of all that he
has&mdash;even from a publisher. It is not there.</p>

<p>These figures of increased revenue to the government are based on the
department’s own statements. They are mathematically accurate.</p>

<p>They must not be interpreted, however, as measuring the extent of publishers’
losses. They take no account of the increases, certain to follow the enactment
of this legislation, in the rates of other lines of distribution from which the
government derives no revenue. They take no account of the loss in circulation
volume, that is certain to follow an attempt to raise the price of magazines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to the public. They take no account of the loss in advertising revenue that is
certain to follow a loss in circulation.</p>

<p>Neither are these figures a complete record of the effect on the government
revenue. They take no account of the certain destruction of publishing properties,
and the consequent destruction of postal revenue on the profitable first-class
matter their advertising once created.</p>

</div>

<p>“<i>Postscript</i>: Since this calculation was made and a flood of telegrams
from agricultural publications has come to Congress, the afternoon
newspapers of Tuesday, February 14, reported that at a cabinet
meeting on that day it was decided by the Administration and
announced by Postmaster General Hitchcock that agricultural
periodicals will be exempted from the increased postal rate. The
owners and other representatives of agricultural periodicals gathered
in Washington to oppose the amendment to the postoffice appropriation
bill at once left Washington for their homes. It was reported at
the same time that the religious periodicals had also been assured that
a paternal Administration would take care of them.</p>

<p>“This leaves the situation in such shape that the Administration
has at last got down to the comparatively small group of popular
magazines.</p>

<p>“These magazines proper, the Postmaster General says, constitute
20.23 per cent of second-class matter, or only 162,000,000 pounds, out
of the 800,000,000 pounds of second-class mail.</p>

<p>“As the Postmaster General says, as explained above, that the
proposed increase would only mean 1 cent a pound more on the whole
periodical, he could only figure out a theoretical gross gain of $1,620,000.
But his figures are, as usual, all wrong.</p>

<p>“From this $1,620,000, that his figures come to, he would have to
deduct, of course, the exempted periodicals and also all expenses of
administering the proposed new measure.</p>

<p>“The pretense of raising second-class rates to do away with the
postoffice deficit therefore disappears.</p>

<p>“A few popular magazines are to be punished.</p>

<p>“The absurdly unjust discrimination involved in the proposed
increase of postal rates on certain subclasses of second-class mail,
<i>leaving the larger subclasses, more costly to the postoffice, untouched</i>,
is shown in Exhibit C.”</p>

<p>But how about this new development, in which the Postmaster
General apparently decides from day to day and hour to hour as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
whether one class of periodicals or another shall be allowed to live
or made to die?</p>

<p>Has there ever before been in America, or in Russia, or in China,
a censor with this power? If the institutions of this country are to be
so changed as to give this despotic censorship to one man, <i>ought
that man to be the official in charge of the political machinery, as patronage
broker, of the Administration</i>?</p>

<p>Now, we come to <i>weights</i>, and here the publishers begin to talk
back a little. In introducing the publishers’ “Exhibit C” Senator
Owen said:</p>

<p>“It is insisted by the Postoffice Department that it is entirely just
to increase the cost on advertisements in the magazines. I submit
their answer:”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Why should the Administration have gone to a small 20 per cent portion of
the second-class mail to increase postal rates? The Postmaster General gives the
magazine weight as 20 per cent of the whole second-class mail, and newspapers
as 55.73 per cent. Why leave out the largest classification entirely and concentrate
all the new tax on a little 20 per cent classification, which in profit-making
and tax-bearing capacity is vastly smaller than even the figures of 20 per cent
and 55.73 per cent indicate?</p>

<p>The real reason why the Administration concentrated its fire on the magazines
is well known.</p>

<p>But let us look at the reasons given by the Administration&mdash;<i>given hurriedly
and weakly, and almost absurdly easy to disprove</i>.</p>

<p>Why are newspapers exempt and magazines punished to the point of
confiscation?</p>

<p>The Administration says (<i>a</i>) magazines carry more advertising than newspapers;
(<i>b</i>) they cost the Postoffice Department more than newspapers, because
they are hauled farther.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It is not true that magazines carry more advertising than newspapers.
By careful measuring the entire superficial area and the advertising contents,
respectively, of each of 36 daily newspapers and each of 54 periodicals&mdash;the
chief advertising mediums of the country&mdash;it is found that magazines averaged
34.4 per cent advertising, newspapers averaged 38.08 per cent advertising.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The statement that magazines cost the Postoffice Department more per
pound than newspapers is easily susceptible of final disproof from the department’s
own figures&mdash;the most extreme figures it has been able to bring forward
in its attempts to prove a <i>case against the magazines</i>.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department states that owing to the different average lengths
of haul, it costs 5 cents to transport a pound of magazines and 2 cents to transport
a pound of newspapers.</p>

<p>Admit that these figures, <i>often repeated in the department’s reports</i>, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
correct. Let us see how the final cost of service for a pound of magazines looks
beside the final cost of service to a pound of newspapers.</p>

<p>Besides the cost of transporting mail, figured of course by weight and length
of haul, there are three huge factors of cost, apportioned according to the number
of pieces of mail&mdash;rural free delivery, railway-mail service, and postoffice
service (Postoffice Department pamphlet, “Cost of transporting and hauling
the several classes of mail matter,” 1910).</p>

<p class="center">TRANSPORTATION COST OF MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS.</p>

<p>By weighing carefully the representative magazine, every copy of a year’s
issue of 64 leading magazines, and by weighing 60 different classes of newspapers,
daily and Sunday, the postal committee of the Periodical Publishers’
Association has found that the magazine weighs, on the average, <i>12.3 ounces
and the newspaper 3.92 ounces</i>.</p>

<p>The Postmaster General’s report for 1909 furnishes the total pounds of
second class mail&mdash;764,801,370&mdash;and the proportion of newspapers and magazines
in this weight&mdash;55.73 per cent and 20.23 per cent, respectively.</p>

<p>This gives 154,719,317 pounds of magazines in the mails and 426,223,803
pounds of newspapers.</p>

<p>The cost of transporting these, by the Postoffice Department’s figures, is 5
cents a pound for transporting magazines and 2 cents a pound for transporting
newspapers, making $7,735,965.85 for hauling magazines and $8,524,476.06
for hauling newspapers.</p>

<p class="center">THE HANDLING COST.</p>

<p>But the department says specifically, in the pamphlet referred to above, that
the handling cost it apportions according to the number of pieces, in three classifications
of expense&mdash;the railway mail service, rural free delivery, and postoffice
service. The total cost of these items charged against second-class matter
is (Postmaster General’s report, 1909), $39,818,583.86.</p>

<p>The total number of pieces of second-class mail handled was 3,695,594,448
(H. Doc. 910, “Weighing of the Mails.”)</p>

<p>Newspapers, averaging 3.92 ounces each, and weighing in the mails altogether
426,223,803 pounds, furnished 1,740,000,000 pieces to handle (taking
round millions, which would not affect the percentages), or 47.17 per cent of all
second-class pieces.</p>

<p>The 154,719,317 pounds of magazines, weighing 12.3 ounces each, furnished
201,260,000 pieces to handle, or 5.44 per cent of all second-class pieces.</p>

<p>Figuring these piece percentages on $39,818,583.86, the expense which the
department says should be apportioned according to the number of pieces, <i>and
which it does so apportion</i>, we have the handling cost on the 154,719,317 pounds
of magazines $2,166,139.96, or 1.4 cents per pound.</p>

<p>The newspaper-handling cost would be 55.73 per cent of $39,818,583.86,
or $28,782,425.10, which, divided by the total of newspaper pounds, gives us the
handling cost of a pound of <i>newspapers 6.75 cents</i>.</p>

<p class="center">THE NET RESULT.</p>

<p>So, using the department’s own figures and methods of figuring, we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
cost of hauling and handling magazines, 5 cents plus 1.4 cents, or 6.4 cents; the
cost of hauling and handling newspapers, 2 cents plus 6.75 cents, or 8.75 cents.</p>

<p><i>This shows that without going into the miscellaneous expenditures at all, which
would slightly further increase the cost of newspapers as compared with magazines,
the department’s own figures show that it is losing on the fundamental operations
of hauling and handling 7.75 cents a pound on 426,223,803 pounds of newspapers,
or $33,032,844.73, as against losing 5.4 cents a pound on 154,719,317 pounds of
magazines, or $8,354,843.11.</i></p>

<p>With a loss, according to its own figures, over 400 per cent as great on
newspapers as on magazines, the department goes to the magazines, of scarcely
one-third the weight of newspapers, and with not one-twentieth the financial
ability to pay such a new tax, to meet the whole burden of its futile and confiscatory
attempt to reduce the deficit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the advertising in magazines, which the department proposes
to tax out of existence, is the very national mail-order advertising that produces
the profitable revenue, as against the local announcements in the newspapers
of the class of page department-store advertisements, etc., which do not call for
answers through the mails under first-class postage (see Exhibit F).</p>

<p>And, still further, the modern newspaper of large circulation is more of a
magazine, as distinguished from a paper chiefly devoted to disseminating news
and intelligence and discussion of public affairs, than the modern magazine.
Compare the “magazine sections” of the large newspapers (and most of the
balance of their Sunday issues), with publications like the Review of Reviews,
World’s Work, Current Literature, Literary Digest, Collier’s Weekly, or even
with Everybody’s, the American, the Cosmopolitan and McClure’s, to see the obvious
truth of this statement.</p>

</div>

<p>I have marked the fourth from last paragraph of the publishers’
“Exhibit C” to be set in italics. I did so for fear the hurried reader
might gather a wrong impression from its wording. The publishers
do not mean to say that it costs the government 7.75 cents a pound to
carry and handle newspapers, nor 5.4 cents a pound to carry and
handle magazines. It is a <i>known fact</i> that both the newspapers and
the magazines <i>can be carried and handled</i> by the government at a profit
at $20.00 a ton&mdash;at the cent-a-pound rate. Mr. Hitchcock asserted
in the official brochure to which the publishers are here making reply,
I take it, that second-class mail hauling and handling costs 9.23 cents
a pound. In this “Exhibit C,” the publishers are proving that, <i>even
if his absurd claim as to cost were true</i>, his method of apportioning that
cost between newspapers and other periodicals is grossly unfair, as
well as ridiculously wrong mathematically.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hitchcock, or his department, suggests that the magazines
meet the added charge put upon them for haul and handling by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
<i>increasing their sale price</i>. That is, let the five, ten or fifteen-cent
weeklies ring up five cents more per copy on subscribed and news
stand prices&mdash;<i>make the readers pay it</i>. Let the monthlies do likewise.</p>

<p>That suggestion carries a sort of familiar resonance. “Make the
rate (tariff) what the traffic will stand.”</p>

<p>Ever hear of it? If you have not, then you must have arrived
as a mission child in the Chinese or Hindoostanese “field of effort,”
and have lived there until the week before last.</p>

<p><i>Ring up the revenues and make the dear people pay it in added
purchase price!</i></p>

<p>The people have a few dollars stored away in savings accounts or
stockings, and if they want a thing they will broach their hoardings.
They have the money. We <i>want</i> it.</p>

<p>One of the surest and easiest ways to get it is to <i>make them pay
more for what they consider essentials</i> to their subsistence, to the comforts
and the pleasures of their lives. They have been buying some
splendid monthly periodicals at twelve and a half cents to fifteen cents.
If they want them, why not make ’em pay twenty or twenty-five
cents?</p>

<p>Yes, why not? It’s the people, and&mdash;well&mdash;</p>

<p>“To hell with the people.”</p>

<p>For four decades or more of our history, that “official” opinion
of the “dear people” has delivered the goods. The Congress, or
certain “fixed” members of it, told us that we needed, in order to be
entirely prosperous and happy, a tariff on “raw” wool, “raw” cotton,
“raw” hides, “raw” sugar and several other “raws,” assuring us that
such action would greatly inure to our benefit.</p>

<p>They <i>lied</i>, of course. But it took us fool people a generation or
more to find out that fact. In that generation, the liars gathered
multiplied millions of unearned wealth and passed it into the hands of
“innocent holders,” most of whom, if our court news columns are
correct, have been spending it to get away from the trousered or the
skirted heirs they married.</p>

<p>The point, however, I desire to make here is that while this
varied and various “raw” talk was being ladled to us&mdash;and most of us
ordering a second serving&mdash;our patriotic friends in positions of legislative
authority, and our commercial and business “friends” who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
steered the “raw” talk, had “cornered” all the home-grown raw and
were <i>selling us the manufactured product at two prices</i>.</p>

<p>But this is aside. I inject it here merely to illustrate how
easily and <i>continuously</i> we fool people are fooled.</p>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock’s prattle about the publishers
recouping themselves by lifting the price on us is of a kind with all
the other “raw” talk which has looted us for forty or more years.</p>

<p>We buy a <i>better</i> periodical&mdash;say a monthly&mdash;for fifteen cents
today than we got for fifty cents thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Not only that: The fifteen-center tells us of our <i>wrongs</i>, of
how we were and are <i>wronged</i> and of how we may right the <i>wrongs</i>.
The fifty-center of thirty years ago told us largely of things which
entertained us&mdash;things historically, geographically, geologically,
astronomically, psychically or similarly informative and instructive.
They told us little or nothing of how we were misgoverned&mdash;of how
<i>misgovernment</i> saps and loots and <i>degenerates</i> a people. That function
of periodical <i>education</i> was left largely to the five, ten and fifteen-centers
of the present day&mdash;periodicals <i>of price within reach of limited
means and of a large, rapidly growing desire to know</i>.</p>

<p>See the point? “No”? Well, then don’t go to arguing.</p>

<p>If you do not see the point, just sit up and shake yourself loose
a little.</p>

<p>“A little wisdom is a dangerous thing”; “For much wisdom is
much grief,” and similar old saws which truth-perverters glossed into
sacred or classic texts. The people are gathering “wisdom” from
these low-priced, carefully-written, independent periodicals&mdash;periodicals
which tell the “raw” truth. It is dangerous. They will hurt
themselves. We vested-interests people and “innocent holders”
must set up some hurdles; must keep the dear, <i>earning</i> people from
learning too much&mdash;from learning what we <i>know</i>. Their chief source
of enlightenment are the cheap, attractive, instructive, independent
periodicals. Our first act should be to cut down&mdash;or cut out&mdash;this
source of supply.</p>

<p>Then the dear people will come back and read what we <i>hire</i>
written for them, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, then the dear earners of dollars for us will not “learn
wisdom” enough to hurt them or&mdash;<i>us</i>.</p>

<p>But, getting back to Mr. Hitchcock’s reported suggestion, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
effect, to advance the subscription or selling price of the magazines
and others of the “few” periodicals that would be affected by his
proposed “rider” legislation. I shall call attention to but one basic
fact which his suggestion covers&mdash;intendedly or not, I know not.</p>

<p>To me, it appears better to do this by a few direct statements.</p>

<p>1. An advance of two or five cents a pound on the people’s
subsistence supplies&mdash;meats, vegetables, etc.&mdash;or on a yard of textile
fabric they must have to cover or shelter their nakedness, <i>will</i> be
met by them as long as they can dig up, or dig out, the funds to buy.</p>

<p>2. A corresponding advance in the price of some desired, or even
needed, article which is not <i>absolutely necessary to subsist, clothe or
shelter them</i> will induce them to hesitate before purchasing&mdash;will
often lead to an exercise of self-denial which refuses to make the
purchase&mdash;refuses, not because they do not <i>want</i> the article, but
because they cannot afford it by reason of pressing <i>subsistence needs</i>.</p>

<p>That these rules of domestic economy apply to the sale and circulation
of periodicals was quite conclusively shown to Mr. Hitchcock
by the publishers. Senator Owens adverts to this point as follows:</p>

<p>“It has been suggested that the magazines could collect the
additional cost imposed on them by <i>raising the price</i> of their magazines.”</p>

<p>He then quotes “Exhibit D” of the publishers in reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It has been shown (Exhibit A) from the original books of account of the
chief magazine properties that the measure providing for a new postal rate of 4
cents a pound on all magazine sheets on which advertising is printed would wipe
out the magazine industry&mdash;would require more money than the publishers make.</p>

<p>Could not the burden be passed on to advertisers or subscribers, or to both?</p>

<p class="center">WHY ADVERTISERS WOULD NOT TAKE THE BURDEN.</p>

<p>Magazine advertisers buy space at so much a thousand circulation. The
magazine is required to state its circulation and show that the rate charged per
line is fair. Some advertisers go so far as to insist on contracts which provide
that if the circulation during the life of the contract falls below the guaranteed
figures they will receive a pro rata rebate from the publisher.</p>

<p>In view of the small net profits of the industry&mdash;it is shown in Exhibit A
that the combined final profits of the five leading standard magazines of America
are less than one-tenth of their total advertising income&mdash;it is clear that the publisher
must be trying always to get as large a rate as possible for the advertising
space he sells, and it is absolutely true that he has already got this rate up to the
very maximum the traffic will bear.</p>

<p>Advertisers would not think of paying more than they are now paying for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the same service. Some of them would use circulars under the third-class postal
rate, <i>which the Postmaster General says is unprofitable to his department</i>. Most
advertisers would simply find this market for their wares gone, and the thousands
of people&mdash;artists, clerks, traveling men&mdash;engaged in the business of magazine
advertising would lose their means of livelihood.</p>

<p>There is no possible hope that the advertiser will pay the bill.</p>

<p class="center">WOULD THE SUBSCRIBER PAY THE INCREASED POSTAL RATE?</p>

<p>The 4 cents a pound rate on advertising would require an advance of approximately
<i>50 per cent</i> in subscription prices if the publisher is to recoup himself
by raising the cost of living to the public in its consumption of magazines.</p>

<p><i>Would the public pay 50 per cent more for the same article?</i></p>

<p>The question is answered eloquently and finally by the subscription records
of the magazines that were forced to increase their rates on Canadian subscriptions
when Canada enforced a 4-cent rate on American periodicals. As the discriminatory
rate was later withdrawn in certain cases, we have a complete cycle
of record and proof. First, the Canadian subscription list before the increase;
second, the Canadian subscription list after the increased postal rate and increased
subscription price to the Canadian public; third, the Canadian subscription list
after the postal rate and the subscription price to the public had been restored
to the original status.</p>

<p class="center">HERE IS THE RECORD OF THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS.</p>

<p>In June, 1907, the Review of Reviews began to pay 4 cents a pound postage
on Canadian subscriptions, instead of 1 cent, and was forced to raise its Canadian
subscription price from $3 to $3.50 a year.</p>

<p>Its Canadian yearly subscribers in July, 1907, numbered 2,973.</p>

<p>At once the subscription list began to fall off, and continued to do so steadily
until in January, 1910, it had come down to 904 names.</p>

<p>Early in 1910 the Review of Reviews was readmitted into the Canadian postoffice
at 1 cent a pound, its subscription was reduced to the old figure of $3, and
the Canadian list quickly “came back,” having reached already in February,
1911, the figure of 2,690 annual subscribers.</p>

<p>Below follows the detailed record, eloquent of what would happen if the
prices of popular American magazines were increased 50 per cent to the public.
In this Canadian incident the price of the Review of Reviews was increased only
16⅔ per cent and the circulation fell off 69 per cent.</p>

<p>The next exhibit (“Exhibit E”) of the publishers shows quite
conclusively “that it would be ruinous to them to raise the rates in
the manner proposed,” and Senator Owen presents their plea.</p>

<p>I am going to reprint here their plea as presented in “Exhibit
E,” but in doing so The Man on the Ladder desires to remark that the
argument, as it has been megaphoned into our ears for the past three
or four decades, that an increase of tax rate (whatever the nature of
the tax), or a reduction of the tariff or selling rate would be “ruinous,”
does not cut much kindling in his intellectual woodshed. It has been
entirely a too common yodle either to interest or to instruct any
intelligent man who has been watching the play and listening to the
concert for forty years. This “ruinous” talk has been out of the cut
glass, Louis XVI, Dore, Dolesche and other high-art classes ever since
Mrs. Vanderbilt, as was alleged, discovered that Chauncey M. Depew
was merely her husband’s servant, just as was her coachman.</p>

<p>If there is a congressional murmur or a legislative growl about
cutting down a rail rate, the rail men immediately set the welkin
a-ring with a howl about “ruin.” If someone rises with vocal noise
enough to be heard in protest against paying 29 cents a pound for
Belteschazzar’s “nut-fed,” “sugar-cured,” “embalmed” hams and
insists that they should be on the market everywhere at not to exceed
23 cents, Bel. and his cohorts will immediately curdle all the milk in
the country with a noise about ruin! <i>ruin!</i> <span class="smcapuc">RUIN!</span></p>

<p>If some statesman rises in his place and offers an amendment
reducing the tariff on “K,” or cotton, or sugar; or providing that the
government shall build two instead of four “first-class” battleships,
the bugles are all turned loose tooting “ruin” for the “wool,” the
“cotton,” the “shipbuilding” or other industry affected, as the case
may be, and “<i>ruin</i>” will be spread and splattered in printers’ ink all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
over the country. No, your Man on the Ladder does not have much
respect for this “ruin” talk, as it is usually “stumped” and “space-written”
for us commoners in the industrial walks of life and in its
marts of trade. But when he hears that warning sounded by men
engaged in a business industry with which he himself is fairly familiar&mdash;a
business he himself has several times had to put forth strenuous
effort to “lighter” over financial shoals or “spar-off” monetary reefs&mdash;when
it comes to talk of “ruin” among men engaged in the business
of publishing periodical literature in this country, why, then, he gets
down off the ladder and <i>listens</i>.</p>

<p>There are two special and specific reasons why <i>every</i> commoner&mdash;every
<i>earner</i>&mdash;should listen to the publishers’ arguments in proof that
Mr. Hitchcock’s proposal means ruin to many of them&mdash;some of
<i>even the strongest and best</i>.</p>

<p>1. An increase of <i>three hundred per cent</i>, as the Postmaster
General sought in his “rider” (though somewhat covertly), in the
carriage cost and delivery (rail or other) of its product would <i>ruin</i>
almost any established business there is in this country, if such increase
was forced in the limited time named in that “rider.” A
suddenly enforced increase of even one hundred per cent in the haulage
and delivery cost of product would put hundreds of our most
serviceable industries on the financial rocks.</p>

<p>2. A business man or a business industry that has been giving us
<i>thirty cents in manufacturing cost</i> for our <i>fifteen cents in cash</i> is certainly
deserving not only of a hearing but of a vigorous, robust, militant
support.</p>

<p>That the periodical publishers of this country are doing just that
thing&mdash;<i>have been doing it for the past twelve to twenty years</i>&mdash;no honest
periodical reader who is at all familiar with the cost of production
will attempt to deny.</p>

<p>That is sufficient reason for presenting here the “Exhibit E” of
the publishers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We point to the history of deficits in the Postoffice Department since 1879,
when the pound rate of payment was established for second-class matter.
The question at the head of this exhibit is answered by the successive changes
in the size of the deficit, compared with coincident changes in the volume of
second-class mail.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the largest percentage of deficit in the past 40 years
occurred <i>before</i> the pound rate of 2 cents was, in 1879, established for second-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
matter; that the percentage of deficit decreased with great rapidity as soon
as second-class matter, under the stimulus of the new pound rate, began to
increase rapidly; that this decrease in the deficit <i>was accelerated after the second-class
rate was lowered, in 1885</i>, to the <i>present rate of 1 cent a pound, and after second-class
matter had increased beyond any figure hitherto dreamed of</i>; that the decrease
in percentage of deficit continued, coincidently with the increase in volume of
second-class mail, until 1902, when large appropriations began for rural free
delivery service. Then deficits began to grow as the specified loss on rural free
delivery grew. In the last fiscal year, 1910, when the rural free delivery loss
remained nearly stationary, as against 1909, the deficit decreased by approximately
$11,500,000 to the lowest percentage but one in 27 years, although in this
same year second-class matter made <i>the largest absolute gain ever known</i>, amounting
to 98,000,000 pounds more than in 1909.</p>

<p>We submit that so many coincidences, taken over a whole generation, and
observed in relation to <i>the enormous production of profitable first-class postage
through magazine advertising, raise</i> the strongest presumption that <i>the larger the
volume of second-class mail becomes the more fully the postoffice plant is worked
to its capacity in carrying newspapers and periodicals and the first and third class
mail their advertising engenders, and</i> the smaller becomes the deficit, other things
being equal.</p>

<p>The other thing that is not equal is the new expenditures, unprofitable in
the postoffice balance sheets for rural free delivery. According to the Postmaster
General’s report there is in 1910 a surplus of over $23,000,000 outside the specific
loss on rural free delivery. A chief reason why the Postoffice Department has
this $29,000,000 to lose on rural free delivery is that periodical advertising, and
the enormous postal business it generates, has long ago extinguished the deficit
and given the huge surplus to spend for a <i>beneficent</i> but financially unprofitable
purpose.</p>

<p>But one thing is proved beyond any shadow of doubt by this history of
decreasing postoffice deficits and coincident increases in second-class mail, and
that is, <i>that the deficit can be reduced with an ever-increasing body of second-class
mail, carried at one cent a pound</i>. It can be, because the record shows it was.</p>

<p>Below is a fuller history of postoffice deficits and second-class increases:</p>

<p class="center">THE FACTS AS TO DEFICITS AND SECOND-CLASS MATTER.</p>

<p>The annual reports of the Postmaster General are the authority for the following
figures:</p>

<p>In the year 1870 there was a deficit in the operations of the United States
Postoffice Department of 21.4 per cent of its turnover.</p>

<p>In 1879 there was passed the act that put second-class matter on a pound-payment
basis. An immediate increase in second-class matter began.</p>

<p>In 1880 there was a deficit in the postoffice operations of only 9.6 per cent
of its business.</p>

<p>In 1885 was passed the law that made the rate for second-class matter 1 cent
a pound, which still further increased second-class mail. It trebled in the decade
preceding 1890.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1890 the deficit in the operations of the Postoffice Department was 8.8
per cent.</p>

<p>The next decade brought a much larger increase in second-class matter than
any previous 10 years&mdash;from 174,053,910 pounds in 1890 to 382,538,999 pounds
in 1900.</p>

<p>The deficit in the postoffice operations in the year 1900 was 5.2 per cent of
its business.</p>

<p>In the prosperous years following 1900 the increase of second-class matter
was stupendous; from 382,538,999 pounds in 1900 to 488,246,903 pounds in 1902,
only two years. <i>The increase of advertising in the magazines was even greater
than the increase in second-class matter.</i> These years brought the great forward
movement in <i>the production of low priced but well edited magazines</i>, made possible
by large advertising incomes, and also in the increase in circulation by <i>extensive
combination book offers</i>, and so-called “clubbing” arrangements, by which the
subscriber could purchase three or more magazines together at a lower price than
the aggregate of their list prices.</p>

<p>In 1901 there was a deficit in the postoffice operations of only <i>3.5 per cent
of its business</i>.</p>

<p>In 1902 the deficit for the postoffice operations was <i>2.4 per cent</i>, the smallest
percentage of deficit in 18 years and the smallest but two in 40 years.</p>

<p class="center">RURAL FREE DELIVERY STEPS IN.</p>

<p>But in this year is seen for the first time, in important proportions, a new
item of expense, $4,000,000 for rural free delivery. Our government had <i>wisely
and beneficently</i> extended the service of the postoffice to farmers in isolated
communities, regardless of the expense of so doing. The report of the Postmaster
General for 1902 says: “It will be seen that had it not been for the large
expenditure on account of rural free delivery, <i>the receipts would have exceeded
the expenditures by upward of $1,000,000</i>.”</p>

<p>It will be clear, from these figures, which are taken from the reports of the
Postmaster General, that beginning with the advent of the second-class pound-rate
system, <i>the deficit of the postoffice has steadily declined</i>, the rate of decrease being
always coincident with the expansion of circulation and advertising of periodicals,
until in 1902 there was a substantial surplus, which the government <i>wisely saw
fit to use for a purpose not related to the needs of magazines and periodicals or to their
expansion</i>.</p>

<p class="center">A REAL SURPLUS OF OVER $74,000,000 IN NINE YEARS.</p>

<p>Since 1902 there has <i>always been a surplus</i> in the operations of the Postoffice
Department, outside of the money the Government has seen fit to expend for rural
free delivery, (wisely, and otherwise wastefully.) In the present year, 1910, the
report of the Postmaster General shows a <i>surplus</i> of over $23,000,000 outside the
loss on the rural free delivery service of $29,000,000. The years 1902 to 1910
have each shown a surplus in the postoffice profit and loss account, the nine years
aggregating over $74,000,000, outside the actual loss on the rural free delivery
system.</p>

<p>How enormously second-class mail aids the department’s finances by originating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
profitable first-class postage can be appreciated by referring to the specific
examples in Exhibit F.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the turning of large deficits into actual surpluses,
which has come coincidently with the expansion of second-class mail, of
circulation pushing, and of advertising, has come in <i>spite of an enormous expansion
in governmental mail, carried free, and Congressional mail, franked, which has not
been credited to the postoffice at all in calculating the actual surplus shown above</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Next the publishers come forward with “Exhibit F.” Their
“Exhibit F” is not merely an “exhibit.” It is an <i>exhibition</i>, with a
three-ring circus, a menagerie and moving pictures as a “side.”
Candidly, I am of the opinion that it was this “Exhibit F” of the
publishers which induced our friend, the Postmaster General, to
loosen the clutch on his mental gear.</p>

<p>Of course, it is possible Mr. Hitchcock did not, nor has not, read
this “F” of the publishers. If such a misfortune has cast its shadow
across his promising career, I regret it.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Well, to anyone anxiously interested in dissipating, or removing,
the federal postoffice “deficit,” the reading of the publishers’ “F”
should be most entertaining.</p>

<p>That F of the publishers most certainly presents some facts
which any man, unless he is a fool, as some descriptive artist has
appropriately put it, in an “elaborate, broad, beautiful and comprehensive
sense,” must appreciate.</p>

<p>Senator Owen introduced “Exhibit F” of the publishers in
necessarily, and of course, dignified form&mdash;a form in keeping with the
exalted position he holds and worthily fills. Your uncle on the ladder,
however, is not, as you may possibly have already discovered, restrained
by any code <i>de luxe</i> as to his forms of speech or as to their
<i>edge</i>.</p>

<p>The publishers in their Exhibit “F” show and, as I have said,
<i>show conclusively</i>, that the advertising pages in periodicals (newspapers
or other), are <i>the pages which support&mdash;which pay the bills</i>&mdash;of
the Postoffice Department of these United States.</p>

<p>I would ask the reader to keep that last statement in mind, for,
in spite of the Postmaster General’s voluminous, cushion-tired conversation
and automatic comptometer figuring, the publishers
furnish ample evidence in proof that the statement just made is safe
and away inside the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, of course, I remember that Solomon or some other wise
man of ancient times has said “all men are liars.” That was
possibly, even probably, true of the men of his day. It may also be
admitted without prejudice, I trust, to either party to this case, that
there is a numerous body of trousered liars scattered in and along the
various walks of life even at this late date. So, there appears to be
no valid reason nor grounds to question the veracity of Solomon, or
whoever the ancient witness was, when he testified, to the best of his
knowledge and belief, that all men are prevaricators. However, I
desire in this connection to have the reader understand that The
Man on the Ladder is of the opinion there are a few men on earth now,
whatever the condition and proclivities of their remote ancestors
may have been, who have an ingrown desire or predisposition to
tell the truth.</p>

<p>This view of the genus <i>homo</i> is warranted, if indeed not supported,
by the plainly and frequently observed fact that in almost
every recorded instance where the truth serves a purpose better than
a lie, the truth gets into the testimony.</p>

<p>The Man on the Ladder also believes there are men&mdash;bunches of
men&mdash;in this our day who will tell us the truth <i>whether they can
afford to do so or not</i>.</p>

<p>I have given this “aside,” if the reader will kindly so consider it,
to the end of calling to his attention two points, namely:</p>

<p>First, There are probably just as many truth tellers, likewise
<i>liars</i>, in the world today as there were in olden times.</p>

<p>Second, There is probably just as high a moral code&mdash;just as
high a standard and practice of veracity&mdash;among the periodical
publishers of this country as there is among officials of the Federal
Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that few, indeed, among my readers will be found
to question the fairness of that statement. Especially will they not
question it when they take into consideration the fact <i>that pages of
the publishers’ testimony were under oath, or jurat</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">POSTAL REVENUES FROM ADVERTISING.</span></h2>

<p>Now, the Postmaster General’s whole talk&mdash;his whole word-splutter&mdash;was,
it seems, to create an impression that the government
was losing millions annually <i>because of the large amount of advertising
matter distributed by magazines and other periodicals</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the publishers in their “Exhibit F,” and
elsewhere, try to show, and in the writer’s opinion <i>do</i> show quite
conclusively and dependably, that the excess of expenditure over
receipts in the Postoffice Department would be <i>two to four times
greater than it now is were it not for the first, third and fourth class
revenues resulting directly from those advertising pages in our periodical
literature</i>.</p>

<p>Before giving these publishers a chance to tell the truth, as
presented in their “Exhibit F,” I desire to make a few remarks about
the point under consideration&mdash;the profits to the <i>government from
periodical advertising</i>.</p>

<p>The publishers present the evidence of their counting-rooms&mdash;the
<i>inside</i> testimony. I desire to present some outside testimony.</p>

<p>I may present it in an awkward, raw way, but I have a conceit
that the “jury” will give it consideration.</p>

<p>Three months ago, there was a “party at our house.” No, it
was not a bridge party. Mrs. M. On The L. has, in my visual range, I
can here assure you, many commendable virtues&mdash;meritorious qualities
and qualifications. Likewise, she has some faults. The latter
I cannot, if the dove of peace is to continue perching on our domicile
lodge pole, mention here. I may, however, say with entire safety,
that “bridge” and alleged similar feminine amusements are not
among them.</p>

<p>The party to which I advert was a “tea.” The guests were six,&mdash;Mrs.
M. On The L. serving. The guests not only had “the run” of the
house, but they <i>took possession of it</i>. I stuck to my “den” until it
was invaded and then&mdash;well, then, my dear trousered reader, I did
precisely what you would have done. I backed off&mdash;I surrendered.</p>

<p>“What was the result?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>In this particular case, the chief feature of the result was that
these seven women, <i>in less than ten minutes</i>, had appropriated every
copy of all the latest, and some a month or more old, of the magazines
and weeklies about my work-shop. They also annexed me. I “just
had to go downstairs and have a cup of tea with them.” Although
I am not entrancingly fond of tea, I did exactly what you would
have done. I went. Necessarily, I had to be good. I was good.
I said&mdash;as near as I knew how&mdash;the things that were proper to say
and as near the proper time as I could. That is, I said little and
listened much.</p>

<p>It is of what I heard&mdash;and afterward learned&mdash;I wish here to
speak. I wish to speak of it because it fits like a glove to the point
the publishers make in their “Exhibit F,” which is to follow.</p>

<p>While the hostess was preparing and spreading luncheon&mdash;a
necessary concomitant of all “teas,” other than mentioned in novels&mdash;the
six guests scanned the magazines and talked magazines. From
their conversation it appeared that five of the six took, either by
subscription or news-stand purchase, one or two monthly magazines
“regularly.” Whether the ladies <i>read</i> them or not was not made
clear to me. One of them did make mention of two “splendid stories”&mdash;“The
Ne’er do Well,” by Rex Beach, and, at the time of the “tea,”
appearing, in serial, in one of the monthlies. The other was a short
story entitled “The Quitters,” which, the lady stated, had appeared in
one of the magazines some time previous.</p>

<p>Now, so far as I can recall, the reference made by this one of the
six ladies was the only mention made of the “literary” features of
the magazines they had read or to such features of those they were
examining. There was considerable talk and attention given to
the body illustrations.</p>

<p>In calling such stories as the lady mentioned “literary” I
presume apologies are due the Penrose-Overstreet Commission.
While both the stories are “brand-new,” are well written, each
teaching a lesson&mdash;have, in short, all the essential elements of
“currency and periodicity”&mdash;yet that commission, in the anxious
interest it displayed to secure “a general exclusion act” against fiction
in periodicals, would, possibly, see nothing of literary merit in either
of the stories the lady mentioned.</p>

<p>I shall, however, offer no apologies to the commission for classing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the two stories as literature and of exemplary currency. On a
previous page I have given my reasons for differing from the commission
on its strictures on current fiction as run in our standard
monthlies and weeklies. The lady’s expressed opinion of the two
stories is another reason for differing from that expressed by the commission.
In my judgment, the lady who spoke has a broader, juster
and far more comprehending knowledge of literature&mdash;of its merits
and demerits, whether fiction, historical, biographical or classic&mdash;than
has any member of that commission.</p>

<p>But to return to our tea party. Those six ladies scanned and
thumbed through my magazines. As said, there was comparatively
little talk or comment about the body-matter of the periodicals.
But those women&mdash;all married, five of them mothers, two of them
(three, counting the hostess), grandmothers&mdash;gave fully <i>three-fourths
of their time to the advertising pages</i>.</p>

<p>But that is not all. Their scanning of the advertising pages of
those periodicals developed some business action. The business talk
started when one lady called attention to the “ad” of a military
school in a town in Wisconsin, “where Thomas attends,” Thomas
being her son. It developed that the lady seated next to her had a
son Charles whom it was desired to start in some preparatory school
in the fall. Another matron had a daughter she desired to have take
a course at some school for girls. Both of the ladies with candidates
for preparatory courses, however, were of the opinion that all the
“good schools” appeared to be in the East and each would prefer to
send her son or daughter to some school nearer home. To this
opinion the mother of the boy attending the Wisconsin school earnestly
protested.</p>

<p>“We have just as good preparatory schools, colleges and universities
in the West as they have in the East,” she declared. “My
boy is doing splendidly at the&mdash;&mdash;, Wisconsin. He has
been there two terms now. If you don’t want to send Charles to a
military school, there are a score or more of excellent schools for
either boys or girls in the West and South&mdash;some of them right near
us, too. Just look here!”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then began a scurrying through the school “ad” pages of
three or four of the magazines for the names and locations of preparatory
schools. The advertisements of a number were found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take the names and addresses and write all of them for their
catalogues or prospectuses or pamphlets, giving the courses of study
that pupils may take, the advantages they offer and other information.
That’s what I did before deciding where to send Thomas. I
wrote twenty-two different military schools in the country and got a
prompt reply from each of them. In fact some of them wrote me
<i>four or five times</i>, besides sending their little printed books which gave
their courses of study and set forth the special advantages their
students enjoyed.”</p>

<p>Of course, it was Thomas’ mother who spoke. Her suggestion,
however, gripped the rails at once. The two matrons with children
to place in preparatory schools asked for pencil and paper. I
relieved them of the immediate labor of writing out their lists, by
gallantly inviting them to take home with them such of the magazines
as they thought would serve their purpose, and, as they were near
neighbors, they could scan them at their leisure and address directly
from the advertisements. I lost three of my favorite magazines on
my tender.</p>

<p>“This has no bearing on the point!” Eh? Well, let us see about
that.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not know what the mothers of that son and
daughter who were to be started in preparatory school work did.
It is safe to presume however, that they adopted the plan suggested
by Thomas’ mother. We know what she did. At any rate we have
her own statement of the course she pursued, and there can be
advanced no valid reason for doubting her word. Besides, as she is
our “next-door” neighbor, I have made, within the month, special
inquiry of her as to what she did. I found that she had kept the
catalogues of the schools to which she had written and had carefully
“filed” in a <i>twined package</i>, as a careful housekeeper usually files
things, every letter she had received from the schools.</p>

<p>More than that: She wrote nine of the schools a second letter
and three of them, she wrote <i>four times</i>. To the Wisconsin school
to which she finally intrusted the training and instruction of her son
she wrote <i>six times</i>.</p>

<p>Now let us see what revenue the federal postal fund <i>actually</i>
received from this one mother in her efforts to place her boy in a good,
safe school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>First the mother herself wrote forty-five letters. On these the
Postoffice Department collected 90 cents.</p>

<p>Second, her “twine file” shows that, all told, she had received
from the twenty-two schools written to, a total of 163 letters. On
these the government collected $3.26.</p>

<p>Third, the catalogues sent her were of various sizes. Their
carriage charge, at third-class rates, I think would range from two
to six cents or more. Putting the average at only three cents,
which in my judgment is low, the government collected for their
carriage 66 cents.</p>

<p>Fourth, thirteen of the schools, either not knowing her boy had
been matriculated or thinking she might have other boys “comin’ on”
to preparatory school age, sent her their catalogues for the following
year&mdash;another 39 cents.</p>

<p>Add those four items and you will readily ascertain that the
government received $5.21 in revenue from the efforts of Thomas’
mother to select a school for him&mdash;a school that would give him military
training and discipline, as well as academic instruction in selected
studies.</p>

<p><i>Her course of action was prompted entirely by the school advertisements
she saw in two magazines.</i></p>

<p>How many other mothers and fathers were influenced to similar
action by the three or four school “ad” pages in those two magazines
I do not know. There must, however, have been many, I take it,
otherwise the schools and preparatory colleges would not persist in
advertising so extensively, year after year, during the summer
months, in our high-class monthly and weekly periodicals.</p>

<p>The two magazines from which Thomas’ mother got her school
address weighed a little under a pound each. If they reached her
by mail, the government got only about two cents for their carriage
and delivery, which was ample pay&mdash;$20.00 a ton&mdash;for the service.
But supposing Mr. Hitchcock’s wild figures were correct&mdash;that it cost
the government 18 cents to deliver those two magazines to that
mother&mdash;a rate of $180.00 per ton. Of course, no man could so
suppose unless he stood on his head in one corner of a room and
figured results as the square of the distance at which things appeared
to him, or chanced to be one of those “blessed” mortals prenatally
endowed with what may be called mental strabismus. But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sake of the argument, let us suppose that it did cost the government
18 cents to deliver those two magazines to Thomas’ mother; let us
admit that that falsehood is fact, that that foolishness is sense. Then
what?</p>

<p>A magazine weighing one pound and printed on the grade of
paper used by our high-class periodicals will count 250 or more
pages. Four pages of school “ads,” therefore, would count for about
<i>one-fourth of one ounce</i>.</p>

<p>Even at Mr. Hitchcock’s absurd figure of nine cents a pound, the
cost to the government of carrying those four pages of school advertisements
in each of two monthly magazines to the mother of Thomas
<i>was less than four-fifths of one cent</i>.</p>

<p>Do you grasp the point?</p>

<p>Remember, Mr. Hitchcock has separated himself from much talk
to show to a doubting public that it is <i>the advertising pages of periodicals
which over-burden the postal service and are responsible, largely,
for the alleged “deficit.”</i></p>

<p>I say “alleged” deficit. I say so, because it is not, and never was,
a deficit <i>de facto</i>. I shall later give my reasons for so saying&mdash;shall
show that this much talked of deficit in the Postoffice Department’s
revenues is <i>quasi</i> only&mdash;a mere matter of accounting, and bad accounting
at that.</p>

<p>But here we are considering the cost to the government of carrying
and delivering <i>advertising pages</i> to the reading public of this
Nation. Especially are we considering the transaction between the
government and the mother of Thomas&mdash;a transaction induced and
promoted by eight pages of advertising&mdash;four pages in each of two
magazines.</p>

<p>As just stated, it cost the government <i>less than four-fifths of one
cent</i>, even if we rate the carriage and delivery cost at Postmaster
General Hitchcock’s absurd figure of nine cents a pound, to deliver
those eight pages of school advertisement to Thomas’ mother.
Even the delivery of the <i>complete</i> magazines which printed those
advertising pages would, at Mr. Hitchcock’s own figures, cost the
government only about 18 cents. Let’s admit it all&mdash;the worst of it,
and the worst possible construction that the worst will stand. Then
how does the government stand in relation to the resultant transaction&mdash;<i>the
transaction induced by those eight pages of advertising</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It cost the government 18 cents, according to Mr. Hitchcock’s
method of hurdle estimating, to deliver those two magazines to
Thomas’ mother. Well, let it go at that. The government is out,
then, 16 cents, the publisher having paid in 2 cents at the present
pound rate for mail carriage and delivery.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those two magazines each carried four pages
of school “ads.” Those “ads” start Thomas’ mother into a canvass of
the schools by correspondence. The result of that canvass, as
previously shown, turned into the government’s treasury <i>a gross
revenue of</i> $5.21 for postage stamps to cover the first and third-class
business resulting.</p>

<p>The government, then, is $5.05 ahead so far as <i>gross</i> receipts and
<i>gross</i> revenues are concerned, and it is ahead that sum, in the
specific transaction under consideration, <i>solely and only because of
those eight pages of school advertisements printed in the two magazines</i>.</p>

<p>Is that not a fair&mdash;a just&mdash;statement?</p>

<p>As Mr. Hitchcock states that there is a large profit to the government
for the stamps sold and as that $5.21 was <i>all for stamps</i>, then
those eight pages of advertisements and Thomas’ mother must have
turned into the postal fund a handsome <i>net</i> profit on the service
rendered by the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>Now, I desire to return to our “tea.” Two other “business”
actions developed which serve to prove the statement made on a
previous page, namely: <i>It is the advertising pages of our periodicals
which yield the largest revenue to the government for the postal service
it renders.</i></p>

<p>The first of the two postal revenue-producers came up as we sat
at luncheon. Each of the ladies had a magazine or weekly in hand.
There was as much talking as eating in progress, or more. I presume
that is the proper procedure or practice at “tea” luncheons. I am
not a competent authority on “tea” proprieties.</p>

<p>One of the ladies “had the floor,” so to speak, and expatiated
eloquently and at length on the merits of an electrically heated flat-iron
or sad-iron, an advertisement of which she had found in the
magazine she was scanning&mdash;a cloth smoother she had had in use for
some three months. Three of the other matrons were wired&mdash;that is,
their homes were electrically lighted. The others were getting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
domiciliary illumination from what is vulgarly designated as the
“Chicago Gas Trust,” at 85 cents per.</p>

<p>“Results?” Three of the assembled party desired to write for
“full particulars” about that flat-iron at once.</p>

<p>My boss furnished paper, envelopes, pens and ink. My assigned
duty in this business transaction was both simple and secondary.
The boss <i>ordered</i> me to go over to the drug store, buy the stamps and
mail those three letters.</p>

<p>I did so.</p>

<p>The government got six cents postal revenue from <i>me</i> on that
sad-iron “ad.” What further revenue was gleaned from the correspondence
between the three ladies and the flat-iron manufacturer
I know not.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to reach that drug-store&mdash;a short block
away&mdash;buy the stamps, “lick ’em,” stick them on the envelopes and
drop those three letters into the mail-box just outside the druggist’s
door. At any rate, the ladies so informed me when I got back.
They did it politely, kindly, but very <i>plainly</i>. Not wishing to scarify
their feelings by admitting that I had purposely loitered because of
an inherent or pre-natal dislike of teas, I did what I thought was
the proper thing to do under the stress of impinging circumstances&mdash;I
lied like a gentleman. I told the ladies that the druggist happened
to be out of two-cent stamps and had sent out for them&mdash;sent to
another drug store for them.</p>

<p>“How unfortunate!” exclaimed one of the party. “We want
a lot more stamps. We have each written for a sample of these new
biscuits. We have to enclose ten cents in stamps and the letters
will have to be stamped. That’s eighty-four cents in stamps and we
want to get the letters into the mail tonight.”</p>

<p>Then I was shown the advertisement of the desired “biscuits.”
In the good old summer time of our earthly residence, “when life
and love were young,” we called such mercantile pastry “crackers.”
Mother baked all the biscuits we then ate, or somebody else’s mother
baked them. Of course, sometimes Mary, Susie, Annie, Jane or
another of the dear girls learned the trick and could “bake as good as
mother.” Then she baked the biscuits. And they <i>were</i> biscuits.
Now, every <i>cracker</i> is a biscuit, and every biscuit one gets smells and
tastes of the bakeshop where it was foundried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>But that is entirely aside from our subject. The “ad”&mdash;a full
page&mdash;set forth the super-excellence of some recently invented or
devised cracker&mdash;“biscuit,” if you prefer so to call it. It was an
attractively designed and well-written “ad.” The advertiser offered
to send a regular-size package of the “biscuits” to anyone on receipt
of ten cents in stamps&mdash;“enough to cover the postage”&mdash;and the name
of the grocer with whom the sender of the stamps traded. That, in
brief, was the “ad” offer, and each of the ladies wanted those biscuits&mdash;my
boss as anxious to sample them as any of the others. On a
corner of the luncheon table in symmetrical, pyramidal array, was
84 cents in miscellaneous change.</p>

<p>Before it came my turn to speak, Mrs. M. On The L. gave me a
scrutinizing look&mdash;a censorious look&mdash;a look that said, “I know
where you have been,” and took the floor. She did not rise in
taking it either.</p>

<p>“Oh, he can get the stamps. Take that change and these letters.
You can go to some other drug store and get the stamps. Put ten
cents in stamps in each envelope and then seal and mail the letters.”</p>

<p>That’s the speech the boss made.</p>

<p>I should be ashamed to admit it, but I am not. There are limits
to the endurance of even such a temperate-zone nature as that of the
writer. The boss’ speech reached the limit. My patriotism was set
all awry. Even my earnest desire to reduce the “deficit” in the
postal service was, for the moment, forgotten&mdash;was submerged.</p>

<p>I took the 84 cents those friendly ladies had pooled on “biscuits”
and the seven unsealed letters, assuring them I would certainly find
the stamps. I then went up to my den, unlocked a drawer of my
desk, found the stamps, made the enclosures, stamped and sealed
the envelopes, and then came down and passed out on my assigned
errand. I got back just as the “party” was donning its hat to depart
for its several homes, assured it that its orders had been carried out,
and, by direction of the boss, escorted home one of its members who
had some distance to walk.</p>

<p>Now, I think I did my whole duty to that tea-party, and <i>more</i>
than my duty to reduce the postal “deficit.”</p>

<p>I trust the “dear reader” will not have concluded or even thought
that I am trying to be funny or humorous, nor even ludicrous. I
have been writing of <i>actual</i> occurrences, and writing the <i>facts</i>, too, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
those occurrences, as nearly as I can recall them after an interval of
<i>less than three months</i>. I introduce the <i>de facto</i> happenings at our
“tea party” here because they <i>apply</i>&mdash;because they illustrate, they
evidence, they <i>prove</i> that the advertising pages of our periodicals <i>are
the pages which produce a large part, if indeed, not the larger part of
our postal service revenues</i>.</p>

<p>But we must look after our “biscuits” a little further.</p>

<p>The seven women at that tea party spent 84 cents for stamps
to get a sample of those crackers. Fourteen cents of these stamps
went to cancellation on the letters they mailed. The other 70 cents
went to cancellation on the cracker packages which the cracker
inventor sent them&mdash;cancelled at the fourth-class rate&mdash;<i>cancelled
at the postal carriage rate of sixteen cents a pound</i>.</p>

<p>Is that all? No it is not all. It is only the first link in a
<i>postal revenue</i> producing chain.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of that cracker or biscuit, as you may choose
to call it, wrote each of those seven ladies a neat letter of thanks, and
neatly giving a further boost to the biscuit. I know this because I
have seen the seven letters&mdash;all “stock form” letters.</p>

<p>That contributed 14 cents more in postage stamps for cancellation.</p>

<p>Three of the ladies heard from that cracker baker <i>four times</i>.
Their grocers probably had not put the cracker in stock. My boss
got a second letter from the baker.</p>

<p>That contributed 20 cents more in postage stamps for cancellation.</p>

<p>The advertiser sent by mail to each of the seven grocers the ladies
had named a sample package of the “biscuits” and a letter naming
the local grocery jobber or jobbers through whom stock could be
had, the jobber’s price of it, etc.</p>

<p>That contributed 84 cents more in postage stamps for cancellation.</p>

<p>Nor is that all. My boss’ grocer got three letters from that
cracker baker and a visit from a salesman of a local jobber before he
“stocked.” If the grocers named by the other six ladies were similarly
honored then the builder of those biscuits must have written the
seven grocers whom the tea party ladies had named fourteen letters
in addition to the first one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>That contributed 28 cents more in postage stamps for cancellation.</p>

<p>Now let us figure up&mdash;or down&mdash;how one tea party of seven
(I was the working or “worked” member, so am not to be counted in),
and a one page “ad” stands in account with the postal revenues.</p>

<p>The magazine carrying the cracker “ad” weighs about a pound.
The single “ad” page cannot possibly weigh more than <i>three-fiftieths
of one ounce</i>. To carry and deliver that one “ad” page the cost to
the government, then, even at Mr. Hitchcock’s extension-ladder rate
of 9 cents a pound, would be about <i>one-thirtieth of one cent</i>.</p>

<p>But as we did in the case of the school advertisements previously
mentioned, let’s give our Postmaster General the whole “hullin’ uv
beans.” Let us credit the government with Mr. Hitchcock’s alleged
cost of carrying that magazine to that tea party&mdash;nine cents.</p>

<p>Per contra, the government must give that “ad” page credit for
producing stamp cancellations to the amount of $2.30.</p>

<p>Figure it out yourself and see if that is not the <i>actual</i> showing of
the ledger on this account of the Postoffice Department with that one
“ad” page and those seven tea party women.</p>

<p>That, I believe, is fair and sufficient evidence from the outside&mdash;from
the field&mdash;in support of the facts which the publishers present
in their “Exhibit F,” and which I shall here reprint:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The astonishing record contained in (Exhibit E), of the absolutely unvarying
coincidence of decreases in postoffice deficits with increases in second-class mail
is square up against the Postmaster General’s statements that the department
loses 8.23 cents on every pound of second-class mail and loses over $60,000,000 a
year as a whole, on second-class mail.</p>

<p>What is the explanation? How can the phenomenon of constantly decreasing
deficits, coincident with increasing second-class mail, be reconciled? To
be sure, the Postmaster General has been trying for two years to make out a case
against the magazines, and nothing is better understood than that, <i>under orders</i>,
he is using all the figures and the infinite opportunities of such a complex mass of
figures as those of the postoffice, to make the case for the magazines as bad as
possible. Of course, it does not cost the department 9.23 cents a pound for
second-class matter; but also, of course, in all probability, the cost must be more
than one-ninth Postmaster General Hitchcock’s figures. Then why is it that
<i>the more second-class matter there is mailed the more money the Postoffice Department
has</i>?</p>

<p>The answer is that the advertising in the periodicals, the very advertising
the Administration is trying to drive out of existence, <i>is far and away the most
important creator of profitable first-class postage that exists</i>. That, furthermore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the varied and constant efforts of publishers to extend the circulation of their
periodicals by sending out tens of millions of circulars, <i>each making for a 2-cent
reply</i>, and the great and complex business that has been built up around <i>the
originating and handling of advertising</i> have made this national market for
reputable wares&mdash;a market where the purchasing is done by mail with 2-cent
stamps&mdash;the stamps that pay the Postoffice Department’s bills and give it
$23,000,000 a year to spend over and above receipts from rural free delivery, in
advancing that splendid service for the country dweller.</p>

<p>There were published in 1909 in fifty American magazines 12,859,138 lines
of advertising, for over 5,000 advertisers, who used over 25,000 different advertisements,
and it is obviously impossible physically to tabulate complete results.
But let us nail down certain specific examples of advertisements inserted in
magazines, <i>and follow the record right through</i>, of the work they did for the postoffice,
the expense they put the postoffice to, and the profit they brought it.</p>

<p>These score or more of specific instances tell the whole story. Read,
especially, the first instance&mdash;the complete bookkeeping transaction of one
magazine advertisement in account with the United States postoffice:</p>

<p class="center">A MAGAZINE ADVERTISEMENT IN ACCOUNT WITH THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE.</p>

<p>In the Saturday Evening Post of November 26, 1910, was published a 224-line
advertisement of the Review of Reviews.</p>

<p>Three thousand seven hundred replies were received, 1,776 of them inclosing
each 10 cents in first-class postage.</p>

<p>The paper on which this advertisement was printed weighed 0.132815 ounce.
The half of it printed with the advertisement weighed 0.06640625 ounce.</p>

<p>One million seventy thousand copies of the Saturday Evening Post were sent
through the United States mails, so that the postoffice transported 4,440.9
pounds of this advertisement. At 9.23 cents per pound&mdash;the pound cost of transporting
and handling second-class matter given by the Postoffice Department&mdash;the
total cost of giving the postoffice services to this advertisement was $409.90;
postage paid at 1 cent a pound, $44.41; loss to postoffice, $365.49.</p>

<p class="center">MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROFITABLE POSTAGE ORIGINATED BY MAGAZINE
ADVERTISING.</p>

<p>Names of concerns are withheld here. The original documents on which
these statements rest are in the possession of the postal committee of the Periodical
Publishers’ Association, 156 Fifth Avenue, New York City. These are only
a few samples of hundreds that have come, and are printed to suggest the details
of the methods by which national magazine advertising far more than pays its
way when sent out through America at 1 cent a pound second-class postal rate.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Mr. E. W. Hazen</span>, <i>Advertising Director</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Hazen</span>: During the year 1910 we paid the Postoffice Department
for carrying our first, third and fourth class mail matter the sum of $496,749.88.
We shipped during the year 1910, 1,717,514 packages. Of these 809,781
were sent by mail and 907,733 by express. All of these would have been sent by
parcels post if the postal rates and regulations permitted. We paid the express
companies for the transportation of the packages referred to above $347,392.30.”</p>

</div>

<p>The above statement covers only mail matter sent out of this house. The
figures given are accurate. Any statement of the number of pieces of mail
matter which we receive would be approximate, but we can safely state that
it was in excess of 4,500,000 pieces of first-class mail matter. This estimate
is entirely conservative.</p>

<p>Here is another postal bill of one of the many great “mail order” magazine
advertisers&mdash;a company which sells excellent clothing to women who can
not come to the great cities and their department stores. The president of
the company writes:</p>

<p>“As we are a mail-order concern, our business is derived entirely, either
directly or indirectly, from our magazine advertising. During the year 1909
we paid the Postoffice Department for carrying our first, third and fourth class
mail matter the sum of $433,242.”</p>

<p>What an advertisement in one issue of one magazine did for another women’s
“wearing apparel” house is recorded in their books as follows:</p>

<p>The postage required to answer the 15,000 replies from the one-column
insertion in the magazine, also to send the merchandise required by 2,000 of the
inquirers, also to “follow up” other inquirers, etc., amounted to $5,460.</p>

<p>The government charge for carrying this advertisement through the second-class
mails was $38.83.</p>

<p>That $5,460, by the way, did not include the several hundred dollars spent
on postage by the inquirers themselves.</p>

<p>The president of a concern which publishes encyclopedias, natural histories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
classics, etc., investigated the relations with the postoffice of a recent page of
his advertising inserted in a single magazine, and the correspondence which
resulted.</p>

<p>The stamps and money orders bought by the inquirers and by the publishing
company, as the result of the 4,000 answers to this one advertisement, amounted
to $884.</p>

<p>The publishers paid the postoffice to carry that page, at second-class rate,
$12.</p>

<p>Thus, even if it had not already been disproved that the second-class rate is
insufficient, it would still have been mightily unfortunate for the department’s
business if that page advertisement had not appeared. A good business man
would be willing to lose several times $12 in order to do $884 worth of business as
profitable to himself as first-class mail is to the government.</p>

<p>Scores of apparently small advertisers are found in any issue of any popular
magazine. They are just as good customers to the postoffice, in proportion, as
the big concerns using columns or pages.</p>

<p class="center">ONE INCH&mdash;$5,492 STAMPS A YEAR.</p>

<p>A modest 1-inch magazine advertisement is printed by a company, which
reports that its yearly postage account from that cause is $5,132. Adding the
approximate postage on the 1,500 letters a month sent to the company, the
yearly total of postage created by this inconspicuous concern through the magazine
is found to be $5,492.</p>

<p class="center">ONE-HALF INCH&mdash;$590 A MONTH.</p>

<p>A half-inch magazine space is used each month by a certain electric manufacturing
company in the Middle West, but its postage records show stamp purchases
for a single month (November, 1909), resulting from that half-inch
advertisement of $590.</p>

<p>The Woman’s Home Companion paid the government just $583 for carrying
that portion of the magazine on which these 75 advertisements were printed.</p>

<p>Any advertising man can point to hundreds of “mail-order firms” like the
above. These firms can trace directly to their magazine advertising, every
year, purchases of millions of dollars’ worth of the stamps that make big profits
for the postoffice.</p>

<p>It is even more surprising to learn the enormous postage bills caused by an
entirely different class of magazine advertisers&mdash;the “general publicity,” or
“national” advertisers&mdash;who wish the reader to ask for their fine soaps, or
mattresses, or silks, or stationery at his local store. These firms do not depend
on direct replies, yet they receive so many that thousands of dollars are spent for
stamps per year in scores of cases&mdash;even per month in many.</p>

<p class="center">EVEN THE “GENERAL” OR “PUBLICITY” MAGAZINE ADVERTISING CREATES ENORMOUS
STAMP SALES.</p>

<p>A moderate-priced shoe is sold through a number of retail stores in different
cities. The manufacturers advertise in magazines for national “publicity,”
to bring buyers into these stores. Incidentally they mention their department
to fill orders by mail. Thus an enormous correspondence has been built up, of
which the average annual increase alone during the last three years has involved
264,000 first-class letters&mdash;a minimum postage of $5,280. This is simply one
yearly addition to the company’s already first-class business, of which it writes
that “all but a nominal percentage” has been “induced by our magazine advertisements.”</p>

<p>More than $15,000 was spent for postage by a mattress manufacturer last
year, “following up” inquiries received from his magazine advertising, though
it is designed to create a demand for the mattress at local furniture stores.</p>

<p>This $15,000 is over and above his steady correspondence with dealers, etc.,
which was built up in the first place by magazine advertising.</p>

<p>One of the many recent “contests” conducted by magazine advertisers was
that of a stationery company. Theirs is also “publicity,” not mail-order advertising.
It is designed to create a demand for their paper over the stationery
store counters. But their “contest” awhile ago, announced exclusively in the
magazines, brought 59,000 replies, which, with follow-up, etc., averaged 12 cents
first-class postage&mdash;a total of $7,080 in one month.</p>

<p>Here is still another “publicity” experience. In the course of familiarizing
women with a new trade-mark for silk by means of magazine advertising, the
manufacturers incurred postage bills, during the first 11 months of 1909, amounting
to $7,979.75. About $2,000 more ought to be added to represent the stamps
purchased by the prospective silk-dress wearers themselves.</p>

<p>Magazine advertisements of a popular cold cream brought 170,000 letters to
the manufacturers last year, though the controlling purpose of the campaign
was to get the public to ask for that kind of cold cream at the drug stores.</p>

<p>Not including postal orders, special-delivery stamps, etc., the stamp revenue
to the government from these letters was $8,500. And, of course, that does not
include the profuse correspondence between the manufacturers, the jobbers, the
drug stores all over the country, and so on.</p>

<p>Another “drug store” preparation frequently brings the manufacturer 2,000
to 6,000 letters each month from their magazine advertising of it, though that
is, of course, for “publicity,” first of all. A single insertion last fall brought
12,000 inquiries, which created, first and last, the purchase of $750 in stamps.</p>

<p>A system of physical culture for women put quarter pages in several magazines
during the month of November, from which 3,905 letters were received.
In this case, the total postage, including follow-up and correspondence back
and forth, was $1,104.09 for that month of November alone.</p>

<p>Narrow limits would be expected in the demand for expensive silverage.
Yet a silversmith’s two advertisements in the November and December magazines
brought 45,000 requests for catalogues. These had already involved by
January 13, with the following up, etc., a postage bill of $5,510.</p>

<p>Another big postage bill was also incurred, incidentally, by a company which
uses magazine advertising to bring buyers into drug stores, etc., asking for certain
shaving soaps and the like. Still their postage bill during 1909, as a result
of inquiries from their advertising, was $3,656.08. This does not include the
stamps bought by the inquirers&mdash;probably $1,000 more.</p>

<p class="center">THE LARGE STAMP PURCHASES OF ENTIRE BUSINESSES DEPEND ON MAGAZINE
ADVERTISING.</p>

<p>All the above examples are of postage sales caused by magazine advertising
directly, in point of time. Just as directly caused are the sales for correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
between manufacturer, jobber, retailer, agent, etc., in the many businesses
that have been built up by magazine advertising.</p>

<p>A camera company writes: “There is a magnificent revenue to the government
through our correspondence with these dealers, through their correspondence
with their customers, and through their sending our printed matter, furnished
by us, at a postage cost of $100, and such dealer could not afford to go
to this expense were it not for the fact that this local advertising which he does
is backed up by our general magazine publicity.”</p>

<p>This one result of magazine work is figured by the company at tens of
thousands of dollars every year in postage.</p>

<p>The postage-stamp revenue created by magazine advertising keeps on for
months, and years even, between the advertiser and the consumer, in cases like
correspondence schools, for instance.</p>

<p>One prominent company writes that it not only spends $429 per month in
postage, answering inquiries which themselves account for about $100 more, but
that it enrolls per month more than 2,200 new scholars&mdash;and every scholar, by
the time he has received all his numerous “lessons,” etc., costs the school about
$3.50 more in postage. Thus each month creates about $7,700 more in postage
bills for this school, not counting nearly as much again which the scholars must
spend.</p>

<p>“Our advertising,” writes a leading investment banker, “by reason of names
being placed on our mailing list for circulation, etc., costs us several thousand
dollars a year for postage, which would not be the case if we were not doing and
had done advertising.”</p>

<p>In fact, there would be little left of the department’s profitable postage stamp
sales were the big magazine houses crippled. The publishers are the largest
buyers of lists of names used for circulation. To circularize these lists many
millions of 2-cent stamps are bought every year.</p>

<p>“Our entire mail order book business,” writes a Western firm, “has been
built up through magazine advertising. Last year our postal bill amounted to
$12,298.57. This was used on circular matter and letters. If the circulation of
the magazines should be reduced, and it is our opinion that it would be if the
postage rate should be increased, our postage bill would be reduced proportionately.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is much more to be said in support of my contention that
the advertising pages of our periodicals are their <i>revenue-producing
pages</i>, but it cannot now here be said, as I must pass to another division
of our general subject.</p>

<p>We have devoted most of our previous space to Mr. Hitchcock’s
“rider,” to the influences and <i>influencers</i> that originated it and tried to
push it&mdash;by methods adroit and scrupulously unscrupulous&mdash;into
federal enactment&mdash;into operative law. At this point of our presentation
of the general subject of Postal Riders and Raiders, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
my original intention to take up generally the <i>raider</i> features or
elements as planned for discussion in this volume. I intended to
start just here to discuss the Postoffice Department “deficit,” of
which Mr. Hitchcock has had so much to say&mdash;and of which he made
voluminous and eloquent use during his efforts to bring his “rider”
a safe winner under the wire. I intended, as just said, to begin to
write about the postal “deficit” just here&mdash;a deficit <i>which never had
real existence</i>, since the days of the “pony post” and “mail coach,”
save in quasi form&mdash;in methods covering political lootage and looters.</p>

<p>Well, I have changed my original plan a little. I’ll run a few
lines through that “deficit”&mdash;twaddle-talk, a little further on. Here
I will merely repeat what I have already said, in substance at least.</p>

<p>There never has been a postal deficit since the period I have
indicated, save deficits created by official crooks and crookedness,
by “interests” which <i>hired</i> the official crooks and bought the crookedness,
and by department accounting methods which would put
Standard Oil or a Western cow ranch on the financial blink inside of
thirty-six months, or even in twelve.</p>

<p>We will discuss this artistic “deficit” later. Here I now desire
to advert to, and animadvert on, another point which has been brought
forcibly to my attention recently&mdash;weeks, some two months, after
I climbed up here to take a look over the general situation, and then
chanced, through the aid of a Congressman friend, to get my distance
glasses focused on this postoffice foolery.</p>

<p>Foolery, I have written. I was wrong. There was no foolery
about it. It was a <i>calculated, a studied, a cold-blooded partisan stab
at one of the greatest and most helpful&mdash;most up-building&mdash;industries
in this country</i>.</p>

<p>But we will let that point and the “deficit” rest for the present.
It appears that one of Mr. Hitchcock’s much-worked arguments to
harvest or glean votes for his rider amendment was that the amendment
would “affect only a few magazine publishers,” or that “only a
few magazine publishers, at most, would be affected by the amendment
and that they had <i>enriched</i> themselves by the special privilege
granted by the second-class mail rate statute of 1885,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Various newspapers quoted Mr. Hitchcock variously on the same
point or to the same end, and two Congressmen acquaintances
reported that he had personally talked to them along the same lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Only a “<i>few magazine publishers</i>” would be affected by legislation
of the character recommended in the rider amendment? That
is the point I desire here and now to consider. I hope the reader
will go carefully and thoughtfully through the consideration with me.</p>

<p>First it may be said, and safely admitted, that no such legislation
as that recommended in the “rider” previously discussed, would
be sustained <i>by any court in this country</i>, unless its wording was so
modified as to make its requirements and restrictions apply <i>to all
periodicals</i>, or at least to all monthly and weekly periodicals. Even
then, it is doubtful if any court could be found to sustain such a
piece of class or special legislation unless its terms were broadened to
cover newspapers, so numerously and so aggressively are the latter
trenching upon what is generally recognized as the weekly and
monthly periodical field of effort, influence and usefulness.</p>

<p>I think that any informed, fair-minded reader will agree that
that statement is a fair statement of governing facts, unless we question
the honesty of our courts in the discharge of their judicial duties
or question the juridic honesty of some member or members of the
ruling court.</p>

<p>That may read like a blunt or offensive way of putting it. But
we are not writing of a Palm Beach twilight party nor of a Newport
frolic. We are writing of and <i>to</i> a serious subject&mdash;a subject which
vitally touches and trenches into the vital interests of ninety millions
of people&mdash;the ninety millions who are the blood and bone and sinew
of this nation of ours. It is a subject of such grave import as to make
it necessary that we call a spade a spade, a thief a thief, a scoundrel
a scoundrel, and judicial weakness, judicial <i>treachery</i>.</p>

<p>That is why I put, plain and strong, the point that <i>no court</i>
could be found in this country to sustain legislation of the character
covered in Mr. Hitchcock’s “rider” amendment to the 1911 postoffice
appropriation bill, and that every informed, fair-minded man must
concur in the statements that I have made in the three or four preceding
paragraphs.</p>

<p>That “rider” amendment would “affect only a few magazine
publishers,” says Mr. Hitchcock, or as he is reported to have said.</p>

<p>Now, let us look over the field a little. Let us make an honest,
intelligent effort&mdash;an effort not warped by political hopes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
aspirations nor by <i>personal prejudices and interests</i>&mdash;to see who or
whom would be affected by such special or class legislation.</p>

<p>First, the reader must get a mental hip-lock or strangle-hold on
the fact that the second-class mail <i>business</i> of this country&mdash;the output
of periodical publishers&mdash;in marketed values, is somewhere around
<i>one billion dollars a year</i>.</p>

<p>As has previously been stated, and I believe well sustained by
the facts, no business, however well established, can stand an increase
of 300 per cent in the haulage and delivery cost of its output
without sustaining great financial loss. The fair-minded reader will,
I believe, agree that the publishers in presenting their case to Mr.
Hitchcock, to the Penrose-Overstreet and other commissions, proved
the truth of that statement quite conclusively.</p>

<p>Well, if that be true, legislation of the sort proposed in the
Hitchcock “rider” must necessarily, after adjudication, put all the
lesser weeklies and monthlies (those not financially strong) out of
business. Likewise hundreds of the smaller newspapers must discontinue
issue. Of course, Mr. Hitchcock prattled about the newspapers
not being affected by his proposed amendment. But, as
previously stated, no court of justice in this country would sustain
such a biased, prejudiced piece of class legislation as that proposed in
the “rider.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHO ARE AFFECTED.</span></h2>

<p>Let us see who really would be affected.</p>

<p>As just cited there necessarily would be thousands of periodical
publishers affected&mdash;virtually ruined. But, let us go down to things
elemental in this question&mdash;<i>down to the stumpage</i>.</p>

<p>The great educational white way of our periodical literature is
builded upon <i>wood pulp</i>.</p>

<p>In an opening paragraph of this volume I adverted to that fact.
The chief pulp woods are spruce of the North&mdash;even of the distant
North&mdash;and the Northwest. Then come cottonwood, basswood and
soft maple, of the South, Southeast and New England. Of course,
there are several other kinds of pulpwoods, but they are not used
extensively for the manufacture of white paper, unless chemically
treated, and such treatment makes them expensive. Of the pulpwoods
I have named, spruce is far and away the most extensively
used. From spruce is produced the best pulp. In “milling,” it
shows body, fiber, strength&mdash;it gives toughness to the milled sheet
or the Web roll.</p>

<p>But that is enough. I am not an expert in pulp-wood stocks.
The point I am trying to call to the reader’s attention is that <i>any
legislation</i> which cuts down the consumption of wood pulp must
necessarily “affect” some other folks besides “a few magazine
publishers.”</p>

<p>First, a just adjudication of such a piece of legislation as that
proposed in Mr. Hitchcock’s rider amendment would put from thirty
to fifty per cent of our weaker (but excellent) periodicals on the financial
rocks&mdash;put them out of business. They consume thousands of
tons yearly of pulp-wood paper.</p>

<p>It will, I think, be freely admitted that such periodicals would be
out of&mdash;<i>forced out of</i>&mdash;the pulp-wood market&mdash;I mean out of the
wood-pulp paper market, which amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>But that is not all. The strong weeklies and monthlies are not
going to be put out of business by legislation of that rider character.
They will continue in business. They will meet its unjust exactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
by readjustments. They are printing on sixty to eighty pound stock.
Some parts of their periodicals are printed on even heavier stock.
They will go to the paper mills and demand <i>lighter</i> stock, of special
finish&mdash;<i>and their demands will be met</i>&mdash;and fifty to sixty pound stock
will be used. The special finish will give the reader just as presentable
a magazine, typographically, as he now receives.</p>

<p>But you observe that the <i>publisher</i> will be saving from twenty
to fifty per cent in <i>stock weight</i>.</p>

<p>You will also observe that the paper mills will be using twenty
to fifty per cent less wood pulp than they are now using.</p>

<p>You will also observe that the railroads will haul twenty to fifty
per cent less of pulp timber and less wood-pulp paper than they now
haul.</p>

<p>“Only a few magazine publishers will be affected,” eh?</p>

<p>Let us “recast” as far as we have gone.</p>

<p>The owners of pulp wood acres or stumpage would be affected,
would they not? There are probably three to five hundred of them
in the country, taken at a low estimate.</p>

<p>They are not of the “few magazine publishers” are they?</p>

<p>Pulp mill and other investors in pulp-wood stumpage seldom
buy until they have an estimate by some skilled judge as to the probable
“cut” the acreage will yield. For this purpose the prospective
purchasers usually employ one or more “timber cruisers.” A timber
cruiser is a man so skilled and experienced that he can look at a standing
tree and tell you within a hundred feet or so how much lumber it
will saw or how many cords of pulp or other wood it will cut. He
“steps off” an acre, sizes up the available trees growing on the acre,
averaging up the large trees with the small ones, and then estimates
or calculates the <i>average</i> wood or lumber growth on that acre. He
then goes off to some other acre. The latter may be only a few
hundred yards or it may be a mile or two from the acres last measured,
the estimate on which the “cruiser” has carefully noted in his
“field book.”</p>

<p>The second acre he “works” as he did the first, and so the
“cruiser” goes on with acre after acre through a forest of ten, fifty,
a hundred, or it may be a million or more acres of “stumpage,”
always careful to note the “light” and the “heavy” timbered sections,
and marks with a sharp, shrewd and experienced eye an estimate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the number of acres covered by the light and the heavy growth of
timber. When he has covered the acreage his employer contemplates
buying, he comes back to civilization, turns in his field book
and makes a report to the boss. On that showing the boss buys
or declines.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, the careful, prudent boss may have two,
three or a dozen cruisers, covering different fields of a vast forest
section and, sometimes, virtually <i>trailing</i> each other. In the
latter case, the buyer seeks to use one cruiser’s estimate as a check
on the other. In any event, however, the purchase or investment
is usually made on the showing the cruisers have made.</p>

<p>Now, this talk about timber, cruisers, etc., may be uninteresting
to the reader. I sincerely hope, though, he will read it and follow
me along the same lines a little further. My object is to show how
wide of the truth&mdash;how unjustly or ignorantly wide of the truth&mdash;Mr.
Hitchcock was when making the statement, which it has been repeatedly
and reputably asserted he did make, to the effect that the legislation
he sought would “affect only a few magazine publishers.”
I have stated, and have given what I believe to be sound, valid reasons
in support of the statement, that legislation of the nature,
covered by his rider amendment ultimately&mdash;<i>and necessarily</i>&mdash;must
be either annulled by the courts or be so broadened as to remove its
special or class features. Of course, Mr. Hitchcock wanted&mdash;<i>and he
still wants</i>&mdash;legislation of the nature indicated in that rider to become
<i>operative law</i>. It is my belief he entertained such hope and desire
when he asserted that an enactment of the character of his rider
would “affect only a few magazine publishers.” At any rate, it was
with such belief I introduced this division of our general subject.</p>

<p>As previously stated, legislation of the character sought by Mr.
Hitchcock cannot be enacted into operative law <i>without cutting down
the consumption of wood pulp from thirty to fifty per cent</i>.</p>

<p>Such a cut in consumption, I am here trying to show, cannot be
made without affecting the earnings and lives of men&mdash;many thousands
of men and families&mdash;who cannot even be imagined as of those
“few magazine publishers.”</p>

<p>When the stumpage owner decides to cut five, ten, fifty, a hundred
or more thousand acres for milling, another gang of men&mdash;“road
blazers”&mdash;is sent into the forest. If the transportation is to be by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
water, some river or smaller stream, these latter men select suitable
roll-ways and boom yardages along the stream. From each of these
they “blaze” or mark the trees and smaller growths to be felled and
the obstructions to be removed in order to provide a haulage roadway&mdash;usually
providing for both wagons and snow sleds or sledges. If
the transportation is to be by rail, corresponding work is done, the
roadways branching in from the forest to the rail sidings where the
loading is to be done. Not infrequently “spur tracks” are blazed
which sometimes run for miles into the forest away from the main line
of the railway.</p>

<p>Following these men who mark out the “haulways,” come a far
more numerous body of men with axes, saws, hooks, oxen, mules and
other equipment, including cooks, “grub” and other things necessary
to feed and shelter them. These, also, are factors&mdash;elemental or
primal factors&mdash;in the production of wood-pulp from which most of
our white paper is made. Numerically they, in the aggregate,
number thousands.</p>

<p>Most certainly they cannot be counted among the “few magazine
publishers” referred to by Mr. Hitchcock.</p>

<p>With equal certainty it can be said that <i>each</i> of these thousands
would be materially affected in his industrial occupation by any
legislation or other influence which caused a shrinkage in the demand
for wood-pulp.</p>

<p>In the fall and winter of the year (sometimes in other seasons as
well), an army of men&mdash;not thousands, but tens of thousands in
number&mdash;swarm into the pulp wood forests. They are axemen,
“fiddlers” (cross-cut sawyers,) foremen, gang foremen, ox drivers,
mule drivers, horse drivers. Here also is again found the cook, the
“pot cleaner,” the “grub slinger” and other servers of subsistence to
the “timber jackies” of the various camps.</p>

<p>Any material reduction in the consumption of wood-pulp would
affect them, would it not?</p>

<p>None of them publish magazines, do they?</p>

<p>This brings us down to the pulp mill. Of course each mill has
a hundred or more men employed getting its wood floated down the
rivers or streams during the spring floods, or “freshets,” if their transportation
is by water. They are log “berlers”, “jam” breakers, shore
“canters,” “boomers,” etc. If their working stock comes by rail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there are “loaders,” “unloaders,” “yarders,” etc. Then come in the
thousands of mill men, engaged on the work of reducing the wood to
pulp. If the pulp mill has not a paper mill in immediate connection,
as often happens, then the railroad is immediately interested in the
reduced tonnage haul, and likewise every man who works for the
railroad becomes interested industrially.</p>

<p>Even a triple-expansion brained man could not figure these
thousands of industrial workers into the ranks of those “few magazine
publishers” whom Mr. Hitchcock, it is asserted, <i>repeatedly</i>
asserted, would alone be affected by his urgently urged amendment.</p>

<p>Next, we reach the paper mill. How many thousands of men are
employed by them, I do not know. Of the many other thousands&mdash;wives
and children who are dependent upon those workers for clothing,
shelter and subsistence&mdash;I cannot make even a worthy guess.
The reader can make as dependable an estimate as I, probably a
more dependable one. But readers will unitedly agree that all these
thousands of workmen, wives and children would be affected by <i>any</i>
reduction in the consumption of wood-pulp paper.</p>

<p>All readers will also agree that no one of these is a magazine
publisher.</p>

<p>Thus far we have seen, in considering the “reach” of Mr. Hitchcock’s
recommended legislation, that it would have affected the
earnings and the lives of many thousands of our people&mdash;people who
cannot, in even perfervid imagination, be classed among his “few
magazine publishers.” In this connection, however, should be noted
the fact that when the paper leaves the paper mills, with the thousands
dependent upon their operation and success, the paper proper
passes into the custody of the transportation companies&mdash;railroad
and water&mdash;chiefly the former&mdash;and of the thousands of operatives
they employ. Next comes the thousands engaged in the cartage interests
in cities throughout the country, wherever printing is done. In
cities of the first and second classes there is usually found a division
of the cartage interest which confines its service almost exclusively
to the work of carting paper from car, depot, dock or warehouse
to the printing plant which consumes it.</p>

<p>Here, then, in the last two classes named, must be found several
thousands more workmen who would necessarily be adversely affected
by a shrinkage of thirty to fifty per cent in the pulp wood cut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Those thousands, mark you, do not include the thousands of women
and children dependent upon the earnings of those workmen. Yet
they would necessarily be affected by any shrinkage in wood-pulp
consumption.</p>

<p>And again it must be admitted by every man&mdash;and <i>will</i> be admitted
by any man with as much brains as directs the activities of
any lively angleworm&mdash;that none of the thousands here mentioned
are magazine publishers. None of them could possibly be of the
“few magazine publishers” referred to by Mr. Hitchcock.</p>

<p>So far we have touched upon only the <i>elements of production</i>.
While the people employed in the several divisions of the pulp-wood
industry may run, numerically, into many tens of thousands, in the
great division of the printing trades, they run into <i>the hundreds of
thousands</i>. I refer to the great printing and publishing trades&mdash;the
trades which turn the pulp paper into periodicals and books&mdash;<i>the
trades whose work directly educates us</i>.</p>

<p>Before attempting to designate the various divisions of this class,
or to indicate the vast multitude&mdash;both men and women&mdash;to whom
they give employment, I desire to present a few quotations, showing
that these trades and these hundreds of thousands of employes are,
in the slang language of the street, “onto” not only the controlling&mdash;the
<i>ulterior</i>&mdash;motives of Mr. Hitchcock but also that they know and
understand and <i>feel</i> something of the <i>far-reaching wreck and ruin to
homes and to lives which legislation of the nature he proposed must
bring to this industrial division of our general citizenship</i>.</p>

<p>Under date of May 20, 1911, Mr. M. H. Madden wrote me the
following letter. While Mr. Madden may not be as widely known as
is Postmaster General Hitchcock, he not having had the advantage
of a federal cabinet position to broadcast his fame, there are few men
better known among the personnel of the printing trades than is Mr.
Madden, and equally few men there are who are better informed on
the cost of carriage, handling and distribution of second-class mail.</p>

<p>In this letter Mr. Madden speaks particularly of the <i>alleged</i>
Postoffice Department “deficit.” While this much-talked of “deficit”
is made the subject of a short subsequent chapter, Mr. Madden’s
letter presents several other points trenchantly pertinent to the subject
we are now considering, to-wit: that the printing trades&mdash;all
branches and classes of it, from the pressfeeder and bindery girl to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the shop superintendent and publisher&mdash;are alive to the dangers
with which legislation of the “rider” character is fraught:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, May 20, 1911.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Gantz</span>&mdash;For a considerable time President Taft has directed
attention to a supposed deficit in the Postoffice Department revenues, he accepting
the figures of his Postmaster General that the amount of the shortage for 1909
was above $17,000,000, while that for 1910 was cut down to less than $6,000,000.</p>

<p>An authorized statement by Mr. Hitchcock, sent out on May 27, 1911,
declares that for the six months of 1911 there is a surplus in postal receipts ranging
from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000. With the fact kept in view that there have been
increases in expenses in many directions and the further fact that second-class
mail tonnage, on which great losses occur&mdash;according to the Hitchcock plan of
keeping books&mdash;has increased, the manifest inconsistency involved in Mr. Hitchcock’s
discovery is too transparent to permit of discussion.</p>

<p>Factors which have been left out of the reckoning, among others might be
mentioned the progressive increased amount of business of the postal department,
with but slight advance in the percentage of cost for transacting the same; a
general agitation for better service on the part of the public which awakened the
authorities to a fuller responsibility of their duty, and the important circumstance
that there has been a new alignment of the House and Senate Committees
on Postoffices and Postroads, has caused a moving-up process, we might say
shaking-up process, in methods that sadly needed furbishing and of ideas that
required practical demonstration. The effect of improving the system of transmitting
the postal funds promptly to the national treasury instead of leaving the
same to accumulate in the common centers, where they were earned, is seen by the
immediate wiping out of the need for a balance of $10,000,000 with which to do
business. Such an ancient method of conducting postal business would probably
do in the period when the pyramids were built, but that system had finally to
surrender, it being too archaic for even the Postoffice Department to adopt.</p>

</div>

<p>In a communication to me under date of August 9th, 1911, Mr.
Madden gives expression to the following very informative statements:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In connection with the Hughes postal inquiry I would like to inform you
of the <i>total addition</i> to the expense of conducting the Postoffice Department which
became effective July 1, 1911. You may avail yourself of these facts in your
argument, as they are official, orders having been issued by Postmaster General
Hitchcock for these additional expenditures.</p>

<p>The sum of $1,200,000 is to be devoted to increases in the salaries of postoffice
clerks during the current year, while $600,000 of an increase will go to city
letter carriers. The railway mail clerks will get an increase of only $175,000,
making an addition to the salaries of the three groups of $1,975,000. When the
rural route carriers get their increase of $4,000,000 it will mean <i>an addition</i> to the
four groups of the stupendous sum of $5,975,000 to the annual total. The figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
are calculated to startle the ordinary observer, especially when there has been so
much music about deficits.</p>

</div>

<p>On August 15th, 1911, Mr. M. H. Madden, as Secretary of the
Independent Postal League, wrote the Hon. Daniel A. Campbell,
Postmaster of Chicago, a lengthy and strong letter, in response to the
latter’s request for copies of former issues of the league’s bulletins.
I have a copy of that letter before me and shall take the liberty to
quote a few of its relevant paragraphs.</p>

<p>After explaining the reasons why it was impossible for him to
furnish Postmaster Campbell a file of the league’s bulletins, Mr.
Madden continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For myself I have given second-class postage problems some study, have
written articles concerning the subject, and have addressed many organizations
interested, in various portions of the country. In this connection I appeared
before President Taft as a representative of the printing trades with President
George L. Berry of the International Printing Pressmen’s Union on Feb. 23 last.
We protested against the raise to 4 cents a pound on advertising pages in the
magazines. As a result of our work, more than 10,000 telegrams of protest were
sent to Senators and members of the House from organized labor men. Two
weeks later a certain ‘rider’ was thrown in the Senate. The Hughes commission
of inquiry into the cost of handling second-class matter was then created. In
one way and another this movement has been kept somewhat active.</p>

<p>“Some weeks ago the editors of union labor publications of the country met
in Chicago and formed an association to continue this work, the Independent
Postal League being thereby relieved of the task of instructing working people
concerning the subject, the League turning over to the editors, the data it had,
consisting of documents, official reports, etc.</p>

<p>“President Gompers of the American Federation of Labor and President Woll
of the International Photo-Engravers’ Union were furnished with material to
present before the sessions of the Hughes Commission. The National Typothetæ
to convene in Denver will also use data supplied by the League, as will the International
Typographical Union at San Francisco; also the American Federation of
Labor at its annual meeting at Atlanta, Ga.</p>

<p>“In this country there are 2,000,000 organized workingmen affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor and 500,000 who are unaffiliated. These are
opposed to a raise in postage and have so declared. In the printing trades there
are more than 400,000 of the best paid artisans in the world and these are working
in opposition to a raise, and since they produce almost a billion dollars’ worth of
printing each year their protest is worth listening to.</p>

<p>“As workingmen we cannot approve of the inconsistency shown by having
a pressman produce a periodical in Canada and sending it through the mails at
¼ cent a pound, while his brother pressman in the United States would be forced
to pay four cents a pound for the same service. And the “Canuck” can certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
do it at a profit. Here is where a little ‘reciprocity’ juice would taste nectar-like
for the Uncle Sam pressman. For several years our big postoffice officials have
been telling the American people it cost more than 9 cents a pound to haul second-class
mail. In Canada there is a population of 8,000,000 served by 25,000 miles
of railway, while in our country we have 90,000,000 people and 246,000 miles of
railroads. In the United States we print 500 periodicals to one printed in the
Dominion. The merits of the question are so obvious that there is no chance for
a controversy; in fact there can be no dispute on a matter so plain.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, see here, I do not want to burden you&mdash;you, the reader&mdash;with
quotations. I have not done so save when the quotations covered
the point&mdash;our point&mdash;better than I could cover it myself. I write
up to a point to the best of my ability, and then, if I have at hand
some authority&mdash;some more <i>conclusive</i> and better told statement
than I can make myself, I hand it to you.</p>

<p>So please do not skip the quotations in this book. The <i>meat</i> of
it is in the <i>quoted</i> matter, not in what I have said or may say. That
is why I desire to quote further just here.</p>

<p>Under date of May 16, 1911, Mr. Hitchcock wrote over the signature
of his Second Assistant, Joseph Stewart, the following letter,
addressed “To Publishers.” Whether or not it was sent to publishers
in general or only to “certain monthly and semi-monthly periodicals,”
I do not know. I reprint it here as evidence for the reader in proof
of the tendency, or policy, of Mr. Hitchcock to exercise bureaucratic
powers in administering the official service of his office&mdash;<i>powers not
given him by law</i>.</p>

<p>I reprint also for the purpose of showing, by two or three following
quotations, how closely Mr. Hitchcock’s official acts are being
scanned by the printing trades and how clearly and how <i>justly</i> they
estimate the results and the trade and industrial effects of such action.</p>

<p>The letter signed by Mr. Stewart follows:</p>

as at present.</p>

<p>This method of transportation necessarily being somewhat slower than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

<p>The foregoing letter brought a flood of protests in reply. Why
should it not? Why does Mr. Hitchcock, as is evidenced by the
letter of his Second Assistant, seek to make such an unjust discrimination
among periodicals&mdash;a discrimination directly contravening
<i>the basic principle of our government</i>?</p>

<p>Among the replies Mr. Stewart received was one, a copy of which
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You tell us unequivocally, if we interpret your letter correctly, that our
Postoffice Department in rendering service to subscribers will discriminate against
monthly and semi-monthly periodicals after June 30th; that certain publications
of a class, issued weekly, will be favored with through mail service, and that other
publications of the same character and class, issued semi-monthly or monthly,
shall be rendered freight service, and no differential rate provided.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that a distinction directly affecting the majority of the
people could not have been arbitrated, and thereby avoided a period of distress.</p>

<p class="noindent">To Postmaster General Hitchcock:&mdash;</p>

<p>The various branches of labor engaged in the production of printing in
Chicago number more than 50,000 highly skilled artisans and their annual output
is more than $100,000,000. These well-paid working people declare&mdash;they
knowing it to be a statement based on truth&mdash;that the contemplated change in
the method of distributing their product will interfere disadvantageously with
their opportunity for employment, and they respectfully appeal to the postal
authorities to pause in installing a system that is calculated to work great harm
to their industry. Their united, emphatic protest is entered against what they
feel to be an unwise and unnecessary hampering of their industry and they ask
that their appeal be heard on the justice of their claim.</p>

<p>In distributing regular publications through the mails the factor of time is
most valuable, and to inaugurate a slower schedule would greatly reduce the current
value of periodicals and curtail the influence which these publications now
wield. We respectfully direct attention to the injury which the owners of publications
would sustain through curtailment of their earning power, as this would
at once operate adversely to labor. In fact the severest effect would reach the
toiler.</p>

<p>As well-paid, organized workingmen we respectfully call attention to the
policy of protection which has enabled our country to flourish almost uninterruptedly
for a half-century, and in behalf of this wise system we ask that no unnecessary
interference with our trade be inaugurated by those to whom we look
with expectation to forward our welfare as industrious citizens.</p>

<p>In common with other industries, business in the publishing lines is far from
flourishing, and, while our rate of wages is conceded, we recognize that anything
which interferes with the profits and success of employers will immediately react
upon our opportunity for employment. It is upon this basis that we plead, and
we ask you, as head of the Postoffice Department, that you forego instituting the
system of distributing the semi-monthly and monthly publications by freight, and
continue the present method of rapid-mail service.</p>

<p>Labor’s voice is raised in earnest plea for what it considers itself competent
to speak upon, and with the hope that you will aid in maintaining for us our
present conditions, which we esteem necessary for our welfare and the welfare
of those depending upon us, we leave the question in your hands.</p>

<p>I am presenting just here, only local protests&mdash;Chicago protests.
Similar objections were heard from all parts of the country. The
Chicago protest, however, would not be complete unless we presented
the resolutions adopted by Typographical Union No. 16, at a regular
meeting held July 30, 1911. It applies both to the proposed increase
in second-class postage rates and to Mr. Hitchcock’s unjust
discrimination in distributing periodicals:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It is a fundamental economic truth that anything which tends to
unduly and unjustly raise the cost of distributing the product of labor reduces the
opportunity for employment of those concerned in the industry thus affected, and
indirectly becomes a menace to all industry, Chicago Typographical Union No. 16,
embracing a membership of more than 4,000 skilled craftsmen, takes this method
of entering its emphatic protest against any increase in the rate for second-class
mail matter; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The proposed routing of semi-monthly and monthly publications
by fast freight instead of by the regular fast mail service is manifestly unjust
and is a flagrant discrimination against our product, this organization further
condemns those who contemplate this pernicious innovation, and we submit that
the installation of this system by the Postoffice Department is not only inimical
to our welfare as workingmen but will work incalculable injury to the publishing
interests of the entire country; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, These propositions of the Postoffice Department deserve only the
strongest condemnation, and as a means of making this protest effective, we hereby
invite the working people of the United States to unite with us in a movement
having for its purpose the overhauling and readjustment of the postal affairs of
this country, to the end that the service may become one of greater convenience
to our people and be an instrument of promotion to the industries of our country
instead of a leaden handicap on our industrial progress and the educational improvement
of all the people; therefore, be it,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That for the protection of the printing industry we hereby
instruct our delegates to the next annual convention of the International Typographical
Union to propose the following for the consideration of that body, and
they are hereby instructed to support the indorsement of the same by the said
International Typographical Union convention:</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the International Typographical Union emphatically
opposes any advance in the rate of postage on second-class mail matter, and that it
condemns the proposed method of distributing semi-monthly and monthly
periodicals by fast freight instead of by the regular fast mail, to the facilities of
which they are entitled under the law, because they pay for the same.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing quotations are sufficient to show that the printing
trades of the nation are awake to the industrial significance of legislation
of the Hitchcock “rider” nature, likewise that they are equally
wideawake to the purpose of Mr. Hitchcock&mdash;ulterior or other&mdash;in his
attempt to <i>stealth</i> such legislation into operative law.</p>

<p>How many people are employed in the printing trades in this
country? I do not know.</p>

<p>In Chicago alone there are, at a safe estimate, not less than
40,000. A representative of the organized pressmen of New York
before the Postal Commission testified that there were 12,000 pressmen
in New York City and that <i>six thousand of these</i> were employed
on presses which print monthly and weekly magazines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>I have no later statistics by me than a 1905 report touching the
number of men and women employed in the printing trades in this
country. From the figures given for 1905, however, it may be conservatively
stated that the number of persons in this nation who
today are earning their shelter, apparel and subsistence (not counting
the office or clerical forces) in our great printing and publishing
industries is somewheres around 400,000. If the counting-room and
general office forces are included the total number&mdash;not counting
owners or publishers&mdash;will reach at least 450,000.</p>

<p>Now, if we total the people who would be affected by legislation
which must force a shrinkage of from 30 to 50 per cent in the consumption
of wood pulp paper, counting from the timber cruisers to
the publication counting-rooms, we shall find that total to be not less
than 700,000&mdash;probably 800,000. And, mark you, you fair-minded,
conscientious reader, that total does not include the wives and
children dependent upon the vast army of men employed in our
printing industries&mdash;dependent for shelter, clothing and food. If
they are counted, the figures I have just given must be doubled&mdash;probably
tripled.</p>

<p>So, there must be not less than two, probably <i>two and a half</i>,
millions of people,&mdash;men, women, wives and children&mdash;who would be
affected by legislation of the Hitchcock “rider” character.</p>

<p>It is needless, but I must still point out that not <i>one</i> of these
millions of industrial <i>earners</i> nor their dependents who would be
injuriously, if indeed not disastrously affected, by legislation of the
nature Mr. Hitchcock is so persistently, if not <i>unscrupulously</i>, pressing
to force into operative law, <i>is a magazine publisher</i>.</p>

<p>Most certain is it that none of this vast multitude of our industrial
citizens and their dependents can be thought of, nor even
imagined, as being counted among those “few magazine publishers”
who, Mr. Hitchcock is reported to have repeatedly asserted, would
alone be affected by his proposed harsh, discriminating and, therefore,
unjust legislation.</p>

<span class="smaller">MR. HITCHCOCK STILL AFTER THE MAGAZINES.</span></h2>

<p>I have previously intimated that Mr. Hitchcock is still devoting
himself to forcing his <i>ulterior</i> motive into operation, either as law or
department ruling. In evidence of this I shall here quote from his
address or addresses before the Hughes Commission. This Commission
was created in the closing hours of the last session of Congress&mdash;created
as a sort of cushion or pad in order that his <i>unconstitutional</i>
“rider” might take its cropper without breaking any bones or painfully
lacerating the <i>official</i> feelings of Mr. Hitchcock. This Hughes
Commission convened in New York City, August 1, 1911. Following
is Mr. Hitchcock’s opening address before it, as reported by the New
York Times, August 2. The italics are the writers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock opened for the department. He said his
study of the postage rate problem had led him to believe that certain fundamental
principles of administration, almost new to the Postoffice Department at present,
should be closely adhered to. These included <i>the operation of the service on a
self-supporting basis</i>, maintained by imposing such charges as would yield an
income equal to the expenses. They included, also, he said, such an adjustment
of the postage charges <i>as would make each class of mail matter pay for its own
handling, and no more</i>. He would further have the levying of postage rates
made on the basis of <i>the average cost of handling and carriage for the country as a
whole</i>, and, finally, postal laws should be enacted so definite in character as to be
easy of interpretation and susceptible of uniform enforcement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock stated in this connection that when the books for the fiscal
year of 1911 are closed <i>they will show for the first time in many years a surplus of
postal funds</i>, and he hoped that this condition would become permanent. Mr.
Hitchcock opposed any new classification of mail matter at this time, saying the
present classification could be made to include all matter now admissible, and he
doubted the expediency of attempting a revision. He then sought to set forth the
large share second-class matter has in the burdens of the department, and the
<i>small percentage it pays of the total cost or even of its own cost</i>.</p>

<p>“During 1910,” he said, “there were carried in the mail 8,310,164,623 pieces of
first-class mail, consisting of letters, other sealed matter, and postal cards.
This mail averaged in weight 0.35 of an ounce a piece, making 45.1 pieces to the
pound. The cost of handling and carriage for this mail was $86,792,511.35, an
<i>average of 47 cents a pound</i>, while the postage charge was $154,796,668.08, leaving
a clear profit of $68,004,156.73.</p>

<p>“During the same year there were carried 4,336,259,864 pieces of second-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
matter, newspapers and other periodical publications, averaging 3.33 ounces a
piece, or 4.8 pieces to the pound. The cost of handling and carriage was $80,791,615.03,
or a <i>little less than 9 cents a pound</i>, while the postage return was only
$10,607,271.02, leaving a <i>total loss of</i> $70,184,344.01.</p>

<p>“From a review of the rates provided for the several classes of mail, it will
be observed that in comparison with the cent-a-pound charge for second-class
matter the rate on third-class matter is 700 per cent. higher; that on fourth-class
matter 1,500 per cent. higher, and that on letter and other first-class matter
3,100 per cent. higher. While it is true that <i>the expense of handling and carrying
second-class mail is less than for any other class</i>, due to the size and weight of single
pieces, to relief from the cancellation of stamps, and to the fact that a considerable
part of the bagging, sorting, and labeling in the offices of origin is done by the
publishers, nevertheless a charge of 1 cent a pound covers but a small fraction of
the actual cost.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>“The present self-supporting condition of the service is made possible only
by the fact that other classes of mail, <i>particularly the first-class, are excessively
taxed to make up the loss caused by the inadequate charge on the second-class</i>. This
will be better understood when it is noted that although first-class matter comprised
during the fiscal year 1910 only 13.4 per cent. of all the revenue-producing
domestic mail, it yielded a net profit of $68,004,156.73, while second-class matter,
comprising 65.6 per cent. of all the revenue-producing domestic mail, yielded but
$10,607,271.02, leaving the tremendous loss of $70,184,344.01. Thus the deficit
caused by the heavy loss on the handling and carriage of second-class matter was
greater than the profit obtained from first-class matter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock here made a plea for equalization of the rate on second-class
matter on the ground that it would at once make possible the reduction of letter
postage from 2 cents to 1 cent an ounce. This reduction would come about from
the fact, he said, that the present profit in handling first-class matter was approximately
equal to the loss sustained in the transportation of second-class mail.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock said, however, that he did not believe that the rate for second-class
mail should be at once advanced to where <i>it would cover the cost of handling
and carriage, although that should be the ultimate end in view</i>.</p>

<p>“For the present,” said he, “<i>an increase of only one cent a pound is recommended</i>,
thus making a flat rate of 2 cents a pound, which should be regarded
as merely tentative, however, leaving for future determination such <i>additional
increase as may be found necessary to meet the cost</i>.”</p>

<p>The Postmaster General served notice on the commission that if by any
chance it should see fit to recommend the continuance of the present rate&mdash;a
“merely nominal postage rate,” he called it&mdash;his department could not consistently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
do otherwise than renew <i>its recommendation for a higher rate of postage on the
advertising portions of magazines</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>I need make no comment on that address beyond the comment
implied in the phrases and wording I have marked for italics. That
Mr. Hitchcock still purposes to “put over” the injustices covered in
his Senate rider amendment to the postoffice appropriation bill is
made baldly clear. That he still is working that “deficit” as a sort
of “come-on” to his purpose is equally clear. And the ridiculous, if
not ludicrous, feature of this talk before the commission is that it
comes <i>after</i> he has demonstrated and publicly announced that <i>there
is no deficit in the Postoffice Department for the fiscal year, 1910-11</i>.</p>

<p>As Mr. M. H. Madden states in a letter to me, printed on a previous
page, Mr. Hitchcock reports a profit of <i>one to three million dollars</i>
for the fiscal year named.</p>

<p>Later, if I remember rightly, he discovered a stealage&mdash;pardon
me, I mean he discovered an “excess”&mdash;of from $9,000,000 to
$14,000,000 in railway mail pay.</p>

<p>Just in this connection I wish to say that Mr. Hitchcock is
deserving of the praise and commendation of every one of us American
citizens for the aggressive way in which he has cut down expenditures
in his department <i>without impairing its service</i>. Also is he deserving
of equal praise and commendation from us for his vigorous and
fairly successful methods of going after that railway mail haulage
steal, which has been going on for a time to which the younger
generation of our citizens wots not of. Although I may adversely
criticise a man, as in this volume I have criticised Mr. Hitchcock, I
like the man who puts up a stiff fight for a cause, even though I
believe his cause is wrong. Candidly I can see no reason why Mr.
Hitchcock and his predecessor postmaster generals should so worry
themselves over a “deficit” in the Postoffice Department&mdash;<i>a department
in which a surplus should never be expected and never allowed to
become permanent</i>.</p>

<p>But our present Postmaster General has, by his aggressive
action and close scrutiny of the loose, wasteful methods under which
the vast business of his department is carried on, disposed of the
“deficit” and found a <i>surplus</i>.</p>

<p><i>In this he has done what his predecessors failed to do.</i></p>

<p>For this he merits our highest praise and commendation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Personally I yield it to him, untrammeled and in full meed. I object
only to his attempt to saddle upon second-class mail&mdash;the one-cent-a-pound-matter&mdash;the
burden of recouping the government for
the losses on rural route and star route service and the railway mail
pay stealage. I object because I not only believe, but I <i>know</i> as
comprehendingly and as comprehensively as does he, that the second-class
matter carried in the mails today at one cent a pound <i>should
be carried and handled at a profit at that rate</i>.</p>

<p>I also know that just as second-class mail (periodicals), is cut
down in distribution <i>in just about the same proportion will the revenue
from first, third and fourth class mail be cut down</i>.</p>

<p>It is because of this firm belief, that I oppose Mr. Hitchcock’s,
to me, absurd purpose and attempt to make “each division or class
of mail pay for its carriage and handling.”</p>

<p>I am also opposing his manifest attempt to “play favorites” in
legislation and to secure bureaucratic powers for his department&mdash;in
contravention of my constitutional rights&mdash;to <i>your</i> constitutional
rights.</p>

<p>I take the following from the New York Call of August 26. The
Call captions it as “Hitchcock’s Sum Up.” It evidences the fact that
he still follows his folly&mdash;that he is still after those “few magazine
publishers” and after them, too, on his “rider” lines.</p>

<p>The Call reports as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The attorneys for the magazines,” said Postmaster Hitchcock in summing
up the government’s case, “have presented this matter of advertising
in magazines in such a way as to leave the impression that there is a controversy
over it. There is none. <i>The department knows that the advertising matter in
magazines produces first-class mail</i> and that the postoffice is benefited in that way.
The important question is: What effect will a whole increase of 1 cent a pound
have on the advertising? Will it be the means of stopping it?</p>

<p>“We feel that advertising would not be diminished by such an increase and
if such is the case, all this information which we have heard today, interesting as it
may be, is not to the point. Repeatedly we have heard the general argument
against an increase in rates as though our recommendation is for a general increase.
We don’t want that at all. What we are driving at is a readjustment.
We are not trying to economize or save money. We have done that to the best
of our ability already and want simply to increase the second-class rate so that the
first will pay for itself, believing that in this way the greater number of people will
be served.”</p>

</div>

<p>If Mr. Hitchcock is correctly reported in the above, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
appear that something of a change has taken place in his mental
landscape since he put his “rider” on the Senate speedway during the
closing hours of the last session of Congress. “The department
knows that the advertising matter in magazines produces first-class
mail,” he now says.</p>

<p>Did the department know that fact when that “rider” was on the
speedway? It most certainly did, if it then knew anything&mdash;that is
anything about the sources of postal revenues. Did Mr. Hitchcock or
any of his assistants, at the time referred to, make any vehement
declaration of that knowledge&mdash;that advertising matter in magazines
produces first-class revenue? If he or his assistants did so, no one has
reported the fact of having heard such declaration.</p>

<p>In March, Mr. Hitchcock battles valiantly to have the advertising
pages of magazines taxed <i>four</i> cents a pound for carriage and
distribution. At that time he “estimated” that such increase in the
mail rate on the advertising “sheets” of magazines would be equivalent
to a rate of “about two cents a pound” on the entire magazine. As
about one-half the full weight of our leading magazines&mdash;the magazines
which Mr. Hitchcock, as previously stated, appears to be
“after”&mdash;is in their advertising pages, his method of “estimating”
must have been somewhat baggy at the knees last March. Any
seventh or eighth grade grammar school pupil could have told him
that a four-cent rate on one-half the weight and a one-cent rate on
the other half is equivalent to a flat rate of two and one-half cents
on the full weight.</p>

<p>However, we may leave that pass. It is past&mdash;has washed into
the drift of time. If the Call correctly reports him, he is now willing,
or was willing on August 25, 1911, to accept a flat rate of two cents
a pound on all second-class matter. That shows some improvement
over his “estimate” of March last. It would seem that Mr. Hitchcock
is getting down nearer the tacks in this second-class mail rate
question, and, as he has got rid of that annoying “deficit,” it can be
hoped that he may yet see the fact&mdash;see that a <i>one-cent-a-pound-rate</i>
is ample to cover the cost of carriage and handling of second-class
mail matter.</p>

<p>Still, we must not be over-confident about what Mr. Hitchcock
may or may not do. Regardless of what he said or may have said
before the Hughes Commission at its recent session, it would appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that he is still gunning for those independent magazines which have
been guilty of <i>telling the truth</i> about both official and private corruptionists
and corruption and also guilty of turning the sandblast
of publicity on the veneer and varnish under which has been hiding
much nastiness&mdash;political, financial and other&mdash;in this country. I say
it appears that Mr. Hitchcock is still after those magazines. If such
is not the fact, then why does he and the orators and exhorters of his
department go junketing about the country lecturing and hectoring
postmasters, instead of staying at home and attending to department
affairs? If he is not on the same trail he “caught up” last
March, why are he and his assistants trying so hard to work up
sentiment favorable to an increase in second-class mail rates and a
decrease of fifty per cent in first-class rates? Has any considerable
number of our people been complaining about the first-class or letter
postage rate? If there has been such complaints The Man on the
Ladder has not heard of them. On the other hand, it is a known fact
that <i>millions</i> of our people have protested and are still protesting
against any raise in the second-class mail rate. Why, then, in face
of these facts, is Mr. Hitchcock working so hard, so industriously and
so adroitly, if not, indeed, <i>craftily</i>, to get the vast personnel of his
department,&mdash;carriers, rural routers, star routers, railway mail clerks
and postmasters&mdash;postmasters, from Hiram Hairpin at Crackerville,
Ga., all the way up&mdash;fourth, third, second class postmasters to the
first-class postmasters in our larger cities&mdash;why, I ask, is Mr. Hitchcock
working so strenuously to get the vast <i>political machine</i> of
his department lined up against the protest of millions of our people,
unless he is still after those pestiferous, independent magazines?</p>

<p>Why, again, it may be asked, are he and his assistants coaching
the 220,000 clerks of his department and the 60,000 postmasters,
assistant postmasters, etc., on his “staff” to put up a <i>promotion</i> talk
for a one-cent rate on first-class (letter or sealed) matter? It <i>should
be</i> a one-cent rate. Nobody at all informed as to mail service rates
and revenues will question that. But it is equally true that, up to a
recent date, there have been, comparatively speaking (the comparison
being with the millions protesting against an increase in the second-class
rate) but few complaints and complainants against the present
rate of two cents for carrying and handling a letter.</p>

<p>Why, then, I ask, is Mr. Hitchcock so actively cranking up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
departmental political machine to make neighborhood runs and do
some hill climbing in advocacy of that one-cent rate for first-class
matter? Yes, why?</p>

<p>Is it a legitimate assumption to say that the present agitation for
a lowered rate on first-class matter found origin in Mr. Hitchcock?
If it is, then what is he after?</p>

<p>To The Man on the Ladder it looks as if he was still after those
magazines which have exposed&mdash;yes, even displayed&mdash;a weakness for
telling the truth about men and conditions. Otherwise, why should
he be arguing the postal “deficit” in March as cause and reason for his
urgent efforts to make operative law out of that unconstitutional
“rider” and now asking for a flat rate of two cents on second-class,
and advocating a cut of fifty per cent in first-class, or letter, postage
rates?</p>

<p>In his January-February-March talk, the “deficit” was the
<i>substructure</i> of it all. By attending strictly to what the people understand
as a Postmaster General’s business, Mr. Hitchcock faded the
then $6,000,000 deficit into a few hundred thousand surplus, for the
fiscal year recently ended. For this he deserves our highest commendation.
He has mine. Why?</p>

<p>Because Mr. Hitchcock in converting that deficit into a surplus
has done just what any one of his predecessors could have done in
any year during the past thirty-five, <i>if they had tried, and not been
interfered with by dirty politics and dirty politicians</i>.</p>

<p>Still, from the ladder top, it looks as if Mr. Hitchcock is after
some one or <i>ones</i>. If my surmise is correct, who is it he is after, <i>if
not those publishers of magazines who are educating us as to the wrong
and right of things in this government of ours</i>?</p>

<p>That is for you to say, reader. That you may not think that the
opinion just expressed is far fetched or an “individual” to bolster an
opinion of the writer, I shall here quote a few paragraphs from an
October issue of the Farm Journal of Philadelphia. The paragraphs
are from an article written by Mr. Wilmer Atkinson, the Farm Journal
editor and publisher.</p>

<p>I have on a previous page referred to and quoted Mr. Atkinson,
and here I wish to emphasize, if my earlier reference did not do so,
that Mr. Wilmer Atkinson is one of the best, if not <i>the</i> best, informed
men in this country on cost of second-class mail carriage, handling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and distribution. Mr. Atkinson must also be credited with an acumen
in watching and divining&mdash;sizing up&mdash;the purpose and intent of
our Postoffice Department that is equaled by few, if any, other men
in this country, Postmaster Generals not excepted. I have been
studying this question for years. Mr. Atkinson has studied it for
more years, and he has studied it, too, from a business man’s&mdash;a
publisher’s&mdash;viewpoint, as he has been compelled to do, being the
directing head of one of the most widely circulated and read farm
journals in this country.</p>

<p>That aside, my purpose here is to reprint a few paragraph
excerpts from a recent (October, 1911) issue of the Farm Journal&mdash;an
editorial written by Mr. Atkinson himself and which shows that this
astute student of the present federal postal affairs corroborates the
position The Man on the Ladder has taken&mdash;which supports the
statement previously made that Mr. Hitchcock is still gunning for
those, to him, objectionable magazines.</p>

<p>The following is from the October issue of the Farm Journal,
under the heading of “Our Monthly Talk:”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In response to invitation a number of gentlemen interested in postal questions

<p>The National Catholic Editors’ Association.</p>

<p>The United Typothetæ of America.</p>

<p>These gentlemen constitute a portion of the Publishers’ Commission now in
process of formation. The representative of the American Medical Editors’
Association was unable to be present on account of a pressing engagement, and
the member representing The Associated Advertising Clubs of America was absent
in Europe.</p>

<p>This was the initial effort of the commission to bring the entire publishing
fraternity of the country into such unity of spirit and purpose that something
effective may be accomplished toward establishing not only just and honorable,
but amicable and pleasant, relations with the Postoffice Department; to bring
publishers of the different classes into harmony, in order that they may stand
and act together for the protection and furtherance of their common interests, and
for the cultivation of fraternal feelings among themselves.</p>

<p>There were three meetings held, two on the 20th and another on the morning
of the 21st. After much earnest and harmonious discussion, it was decided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the great need of publishers at this time is to have the light turned upon postal
affairs, so that they may know where they are at. To best accomplish this purpose
it was thought that there should be a <i>Publishers’ bureau established at
Washington</i>, in charge of a first-class man, who would be the collector and distributor
of information regarding postoffice doings, rulings, hearings and proposed
postal legislation; this bureau also to publish a paper for circulation among
publishers of all classes throughout the United States, which would keep them
thoroughly informed as to postoffice rules, regulations, proceedings and acts of
every description.</p>

<p>Much of the information publishers get now is fragmentary, uncertain, often
considerably warped and belated cold-storage news, void of substantial life-sustaining
qualities. <i>The annual reports</i> of the department in which publishers
are most vitally interested <i>are less complete than formerly</i>. Many important facts
do not appear in them. For instance, no statement is ever made as to the amount
of first-class matter originated by the second-class, none, or very little, account is
made of it. No attempt has ever been made to gather, much less publish, statistics
on the subject.</p>

<p>Formerly a list was accessible of publications annually thrown out of the
mails at second-class rates, but not in recent years.</p>

<p>The report of the Third Assistant Postmaster-General in 1897 comprises 97
pages of compact statements and postal information in small type; that for 1901,
133 pages; while those for 1909 and 1910 contain only 60 and 65 pages in larger
type, respectively. I am not censuring Mr. Britt in this matter, but simply
stating facts.</p>

<p>Then as to the rulings, laws and regulations, there is not a publisher living
who knows what they are, or can definitely ascertain what they are, from month to
month. They are liable to change without the publishers being informed directly
of the change. What purported to be “The Postal Laws and Regulations Relating
to the Second-class of Mail Matter” was issued in 1910, but in it the law, rulings
and regulations are so jumbled up together that it is difficult for a publisher to
know which is which; instead of being illuminating and helpful, this compendium
is confusing and involved in obscurity. It is a well recognized legal maxim, that
“where the law is uncertain there is no law.”</p>

<p>Publishers have not known that an active propaganda in favor of a higher
rate has been in progress ever since Congress adjourned, but such is the fact. The
Postmaster General went before the Hughes Commission and advocated it.</p>

<p>The Third Assistant Postmaster General, in the early summer, made an
address before some publishers in Chicago, wherein he stated that it was the
purpose of the Postmaster General “to adjust postage rates based upon the
principle of the payment on each class of mail matter of a rate of postage equal
to the cost of handling and carriage, and no more, and that one class of mail
matter shall not be taxed to meet deficiencies caused by an inadequate rate on
another class,” meaning by this that the rate must be raised on second-class
matter and lowered on the first class.</p>

<p>General DeGraw, Fourth Assistant Postmaster General, in an address before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the West Virginia Association of Postmasters, stated the purpose of the Postmaster
General to be exactly what Mr. Britt declared it to be; and he had the
postmasters pass a resolution indorsing the Postmaster General, and even as late
as September 22, at Milwaukee, he advocated “<i>the crystalization of the proposed
increase in second-class mail rates into law</i>.”</p>

<p>Jesse L. Suter, representing the Postoffice Department, brought greetings
from the Postmaster General, to a round-up of postmasters in Michigan in August
last, and said that “the great subsidy extended the publishers in the form of
a ridiculously small rate of postage is unreasonable. Were the publishers required
to pay more in proportion to what it actually costs the government to transport
their products, the people of the United States would be benefited. <i>Every man,
woman and child in the United States is taxed seventy-three cents by way of his letter
postage</i> over and above the cost of carrying his own letters in order to meet the
deficiency of underpaid second-class matter.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And then, of course, the postmasters
passed a resolution thanking Mr. Suter for his “timely hints relative to
second-class matter and commending the Postmaster General.”</p>

<p>On August 22 and 23, there was a postmasters’ convention at Toledo, Ohio,
at which a resolution was proposed complimenting the Postmaster General “for
his efforts to bring about a fair compensation from those enjoying the benefits of
second-class rates.”</p>

<p>James B. Cook, Superintendent of the Division of Postoffice Supplies,
Washington, D. C., also addressed a postmasters’ convention in the West, in
which he said: “There is one thing I am going to ask you to do&mdash;it is a simple thing
and one that should be near to your hearts. Certain publishers have attempted
to create public sentiment against an increase of postage on advertising matter
in magazines.… Many of us believe that the postage rate is class
legislation of the rankest kind in favor of the few at the expense of the masses.
Talk to your business men about it; the Postmaster General <i>is going to win this
fight because he is in the right</i>. Tell the business men that the Postmaster General
feels that he is entitled not only to their moral but their active support.”</p>

<p>At how many other state conventions the postmasters have been prompted
to pass resolutions and have been addressed by Washington officials endorsing
“the great fight” the Postmaster General is making for a higher postage rate,
deponent sayeth not.</p>

<p>Thus it is that an energetic campaign has been carried on by the Postmaster
General during the summer, postmasters being urged to pass resolutions and
“talk to business men” in favor of an increase of postage rate on second-class
matter in order, no doubt, to be ready when Congress meets to put the measure
through.</p>

<p>In confirmation of the above, word comes from Washington to the effect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
“there has been no cessation in the activities of the department to make preparations
to renew vigorously at the forthcoming Congress the fight for an increased
rate. If the publishers feel that they have won their fight and are resting easily,
they will have an awakening ere the year is over.”</p>

<p>While it would not be possible or advisable under the circumstances to
circumscribe the activities of our energetic Postmaster General, certainly it would
be a prudent and wise step for publishers to place themselves in position to know
what is going on injurious to their own interests and that of the people of the
whole country.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Hitchcock is a brave and persistent fighter and as such will respect
and honor those who will stand up like men and defend their cause, and can have
only contempt for those who will meekly sit still while being pummeled to death.</p>

<p><i>If publishers are ever to establish honorable and just and amicable and pleasant
relations with the Postoffice Department they must show that they are men with red
blood in their veins.</i></p>

<p>The essential thing will be to get the right man to represent us at Washington
but this ought not to be difficult.</p>

<p>Among his duties will be to make inquiry into postal matters of every description
that in any way relate to the publishing business and to publish them;
publish orders of the department; rulings and proposed rulings; attend hearings
and publish the proceedings; keep abreast of measures introduced in Congress and
proposed by the Postoffice Department bearing upon the publishing business;
keep subscribers fully posted on everything that occurs at Washington or elsewhere
that concerns them; to advocate such reforms in the postal service as the
people ask for and need, and finally to rally the whole fraternity to resist any
threatened or actual encroachment upon the freedom and independence of the
press.</p>

<p>Here are some of the qualifications necessary for the person fit to take charge
of the Washington office: Some experience as editor and publisher; he must be
honest and just; patriotic; discreet; firm; tactful; must have power as a writer;
character as a gentleman; vision, courage, one who cannot be either frightened or
cajoled; and finally, one who recognizes the fact that <i>liberty of the press is a
principle that lies at the foundation of republican institutions</i>, and must not be
encroached upon, or placed in jeopardy.</p>

</div>

<p>I have made the above quotation from Mr. Atkinson to evidence
the fact that he and others support my view of Mr. Hitchcock’s
attitude <i>now</i>, in relation to this second-class mail rate question. Mr.
Atkinson shows quite conclusively that our Postmaster General is
still, and stealthily, running the trail which the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission <i>scented</i> for him and urges publishers and the printing
trades to be on their guard.</p>

<p>Some pages back I adverted to the fact that the deficit of $6,000,000
for the fiscal year 1909-10 was the ground-plan of Mr. Hitchcock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
for an increase in second-class postage rates. That deficit he himself
has converted into <i>a surplus of several thousands of dollars</i>.</p>

<p>Why, then, is he still trailing those independent periodicals?</p>

<p>Why, too, it is relevant to ask, did he so suddenly hear that the
people of this country were crying for a cut of fifty per cent in first-class,
or sealed, postage rates, much as the advertiser declares the
children cry for Castoria? To the Man on the Ladder it appears that
what Mr. Hitchcock heard must have been a “far cry”&mdash;very far. So
far, indeed, that no one who did not have his <i>ear to an ulterior motive</i>
could hear it.</p>

<p>You will observe that he worries a couple of years over a “deficit”&mdash;a
little runabout, five H. P. deficit of $6,000,000. Then by doing
a few things which common business sense imperatively dictates
should be done, and which, it is well known among competents, any
one of a dozen of Mr. Hitchcock’s predecessors should have done, or
<i>could</i> have done had not dirty politics blocked them&mdash;by doing just
a <i>few</i> of the business things which every student of the question knows
could have been done and should have been done years ago, Mr.
Hitchcock lost his “deficit”&mdash;his ground-plan for attack on second-class
rates&mdash;<i>and found a surplus instead</i>.</p>

<p>The Man on the Ladder does not desire to appear impertinent
nor even finicky in his type conversation on this point, but in simple
justice to the magnitude of the question he is constrained to ask: Is a
“deficit” so essentially necessary to Mr. Hitchcock in a fight to put
certain independent periodicals on the financial skids that he must,
losing one deficit, <i>immediately set about creating another</i>?</p>

<p>That is just what his move to cut the mail rate on first-class,
or sealed, matter must lead to&mdash;lead to temporarily of course.
In the end a one-cent rate per ounce or fraction thereof will win to
a paying basis. That rate will mean a cut of sixteen cents a
pound from thirty-two cents a pound for carriage and handling
letters and other sealed matter of the first-class. Certainly the postoffice
can haul and distribute such matter at a profit at that rate.
However, it is equally certain that the department will not handle
such matter at a profit for two, three or more years&mdash;not so handle it
until numerous causes of waste, inhering in the department for years,
are sloughed and the department put under <i>strict business management</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and not left under partisan political management as now and as
it has been for thirty-five or forty years.</p>

<p>With the postal and post card facilities now furnished at the
one-cent rate, no considerable number of our people are complaining
about the two-cent rate for letters and other sealed matter. But all
will welcome a flat rate of one cent on such matter at the present
weights. If they get it, either with or without Mr. Hitchcock’s
assistance, the people will be getting only what they are entitled to,
deficit or no deficit. However, if Mr. Hitchcock thinks a “deficit”
necessary armament in his fight to increase second-class mail rates&mdash;to
increase such rates, as it would appear, on a certain few periodicals
which print and publish <i>what the people want to hear and read and not
what a few federal officeholders tell them to print and publish</i>, then a cut
of 50 per cent in the present first-class postage rates will most certainly
create that deficit for him.</p>

<p>In a few years, of course, after business has adjusted itself to the
lower rate and the fathers, mothers and sweethearts of the country
have learned that they can write a letter to John, Mary, Thomas or
Lucy and have it delivered for one cent, whereas it now costs two
cents, then Mr. Hitchcock’s <i>created</i> deficit will fade away&mdash;will again
fade into a surplus.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Mr. Hitchcock and associate coterie
who apparently are gunning for periodicals <i>which dare tell the truth</i>,
will have a “deficit” to use as wadding in their verbal, oratorical and
<i>franked</i> ordnance.</p>

<p>The 1910 report of the Postoffice Department sets up something
over $202,000,000 as receipts from cancellation of stamps, or stamp
sales. Of course, millions of dollars’ worth of those stamps were
bought for and canceled in third and fourth class service, catalogues,
books, etc.&mdash;in third-class carriage and handling, and merchandise
parcels in fourth class. One has no data&mdash;nor can he obtain such data
from the Postoffice Department records&mdash;to show what sum or portion
of that $202,000,000 worth of stamps was canceled in the transmission
of letters and other sealed matter of the first-class. But it may be
conservatively stated that if Mr. Hitchcock succeeds in cutting down
or curtailing the circulation of weekly and monthly periodicals&mdash;especially
their advertising pages&mdash;he will have no trouble in finding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for two or three years at least, a shrinkage of from $50,000,000 to
$75,000,000 in that stamp account.</p>

<p>That, with the falling away in <i>paid</i> second-class matter, will
provide him a “deficit” which should make him jubilant&mdash;should
furnish wadding for his embrasured guns for two or three years in his
attack on those recalcitrant periodicals which attend to their <i>own
business</i> in a clean, truthful way and expect nothing of a Postmaster
General other than that he attend strictly and efficiently to his business,
to the business of the Postoffice Department&mdash;to the business of
collecting, transporting and distributing the federal mails.</p>

<p>I have probably discussed Mr. Hitchcock, his faults and his
excellencies sufficiently. I will therefore, pass to another phase of
our general subject.</p>

<h3>THE HUGHES COMMISSION.</h3>

<p>First, however, I must introduce a few paragraphs here in summary
of the work done by the Hughes Commission at its August
session in New York City. The commission comprised Associate
Justice Hughes, President Lowell of Harvard University, and H. A.
Wheeler, President of the Chicago Association of Commerce. That
this triumvirate of gentlemen will act disinterestedly and fairly, so
far as their knowledge and the evidence relating to postal affairs
extends, there is here no question.</p>

<p>That they have not and will not dig up and uncover facts and
data relating to the haulage and handling of second-class mail matter,
beyond that already known to and on file with government officials,
is equally certain. No finer trinity of men could well have been
selected by President Taft, but the fact is none of the three has had
any opportunity to make a study of the federal mail service, second-class
or other. Or if they have had such opportunity, the press of
official and private business in other lines and directions preventing,
in large extent, their study of postal service costs and affairs. No
doubt, these three gentlemen will do the very best and fairest they
can&mdash;or know how to do&mdash;with the evidence presented to them. Still,
I am of the opinion that they will discover little which has not already
been discovered&mdash;which, as Congressman Moon said on the floor of the
House last March (1911), “has already been discovered and filed for
departmental and official reference.” Each of them is a man of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
academic training but neither of them, so far as The Man on the
Ladder has been able to learn, had made, as previously stated, any
qualifying study of federal postal affairs. So the best we have a right
to expect from them is that they will tell the story, draped in new or
different verbiage, told by predecessor commissions on second-class
postal rates, costs of haulage and handling the same, etc.</p>

<p>Incidentally it may be said with all due courtesy and respect that
the Hughes Commission will probably succeed in spending the $50,000
appropriated for its expenses, subsistence, incidentals, etc. The
present commission would not be loyal to precedent if it permitted
any of that $50,000 to return to the general fund as an “unexpended
balance.”</p>

<p>Just here I desire to introduce a few items from the testimony of
Mr. Wilmer Atkinson before the Hughes Commission, which, in
August last began strenuous efforts to spend $50,000 and to discover
and report upon facts anent the cost of hauling and handling second-class
mail matter&mdash;which facts have already been collected, collated
and filed with labored, likewise expensive, care somewheres in the
government’s archives. I have quoted from Mr. Atkinson several
times in forward pages. I desire to quote here from his testimony
before this Hughes Commission, because the Hughes Commission
is the latest and “best seller” on the second class mail shelf and
because I recognize in Mr. Atkinson one of the first and most
dependable authorities in the country on the cost of carriage,
handling and distribution of mail&mdash;whether of the second or any
other class. Especially do I desire to quote part of his testimony
before the Hughes Commission because I am of the opinion that
the reader, as well as the Commission, must necessarily gather
forcefully pertinent facts from it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To ascertain what second-class matter costs has been found to be a puzzling
proposition. Many have tried to solve the puzzle and all have failed.</p>

<p>The Joint Congressional Commission consisting of Penrose, Carter and Clay
for the Senate, and Overstreet, Moon and Gardner for the House, with the aid
of numerous expert accountants, at a cost of a quarter of a million dollars (according
to the President’s statement), attempted it and gave it up. All these
gentlemen are on record as declaring that it is a task impossible of accomplishment.</p>

<p>Senator Bristow, a former Assistant Postmaster General, who has given
postal questions much careful study, said in a recent speech that “It does not cost
nine cents a pound, nor can the Department ascertain with even approximate accuracy
what is the cost of handling any special class of mail. It would be just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
easy for the Pennsylvania Railroad to state in dollars and cents what it costs to
haul a ton of coal from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, or 100 pounds of silk from Pittsburgh
to Indianapolis, as for the Postoffice Department to state what it costs the
Department to handle newspapers or magazines. Anyone familiar with transportation
knows that such calculations cannot be made with accuracy, because
there are so many unassignable expenses that must be considered&mdash;expenditures
that cannot be subdivided and assigned to the different classes of freight. The
same is true as to the different classes of mail.”</p>

<p>Postal officials have exhausted conjecture as a basis for a correct solution of
this problem. Nearly every year there has been a new guess. Mr. Madden,
Third Assistant Postmaster-General for seven years up to 1907, guessed that it
cost 4 cents a pound. His successor, Mr. Lawshe, guessed 2½ cents and then the
next year 4 cents. For the last two years the Department’s guess has been 9
cents.</p>

<p>The Penrose-Overstreet Commission declared, while it is impossible to
ascertain with certainty what the cost is, the members of the Commission gave
it as their opinion that “<i>One cent a pound is approximately adequate compensation
for handling and transporting second-class matter.</i>”</p>

<p>I am confident that there is a better way of solving the problem than has
heretofore been tried. This consists in the direct application of plain, old-fashioned
common sense to it. A little gumption in such a matter as this is far
better than fanciful guessing or astute figuring by experts, who are bent on
finding something that is not there.</p>

<p>In working out this problem I have adopted a method quite different and
have obtained results quite unlike the foregoing. I show the relation of second-class
mail to stamp mail extending over a period of 25 years, from 1885 to 1910.
This covers the entire period since the institution of the cent a pound rate.</p>

<p>I go back still further to 1876 when the postage rate on newspapers was 4
times greater than now, when the sale of stamps was less than one-eleventh what
it is now, <i>and while deficits were larger</i>.</p>

<p>The highest point reached in the weight of second-class matter previous to
the institution of the present rate, was 101,057,963 pounds.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly declared officially that second-class matter originates
large quantities of other classes of mail, and in the official figures we have
the proof.</p>

<p>While population increased from 1885 to 1910 only a little more than double,
the revenue from the sale of stamps, etc., and the weight of second-class matter,
each increased over 5 times. <i>No other possible reason can be assigned for the
increase in stamp mail, and the tremendous development of every branch of the
postal business 5 times faster than the growth of population, than the increased
circulation and influence of the newspaper and periodical press, brought about by
the reduced postage rate.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second-Class matter would have long ago wiped out all deficits
and created an enormous annual surplus had it not been for the great
burdens which weighed the service down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></span></p>

<p>There would have been a surplus, instead of a deficit, every year since 1901,
had allowance been made for the extraordinary cost of free rural delivery, and in
1910, the surplus would have been $31,075,170.12.</p>

<p>If also allowance had been made for free government matter, other than the
Postoffice Department’s own free matter, being sent stamped as first-class matter
is, the surplus for 1910 would have been $51,075,470.12 and these figures like all
others here given, are from official reports.</p>

<p class="center">A VAST INCREASE OF EXPENDITURES.</p>

<p><i>Not only did stamp mail, under the stimulus of the steady and enormous increase
of second-class matter, enable the Department to meet the cost of rural delivery while
reducing the deficit, but it also met and overcame the immense increase of the annual
expenditures for railroad transportation which grew from $33,523,902.18 in 1901 to
$44,654,515.97 in 1910: of salaries to postmasters, assistants and clerks which grew
from $32,790,253.39 in 1901 to $65,582,533.57 in 1910, of the railway mail service
which grew from $9,675,436.52 to $19,385,096.97 in 1910, and of the city delivery
service which grew from $15,752,600 in 1901 to $36,841,407.40 in 1910. In these
four items alone there was an increase in annual expenditures in the last ten years
of $74,721,361.82, for which second-class matter was only in a very limited way
responsible.</i></p>

<p>Entirely too much stress has been placed upon the cost of second-class
matter, for it makes little difference whether it costs 2½ cents or 4 cents or 9
cents, or even more, if it produce results commensurate with its cost, and this it
would do <i>if the cost were double the highest guess yet made</i>. The Government could
afford to carry it free rather than not carry it at all, for without it the bottom
would drop out of the Postal Establishment. As long as the people get the
benefit of the low rate, as they are doing now, for which we have official testimony,
it matters not what the rate is except that it should be kept at the very
bottom notch.</p>

<p class="center">WHY THE POSTAGE RATE WAS MADE LOW.</p>

<p>Even if the cost of second-class matter should be declared to be more than
one cent per pound, it would not be good public policy for Congress to increase it,
because much reading matter would be placed out of the reach of many who now
are receiving the benefit of it.</p>

<p>Postmaster-General Meyer said in his report for 1908: “The charge for
carrying second-class mail matter was intentionally fixed below cost for the
purpose of encouraging the dissemination of information of educational value to
the people, <i>and the benefit of the cheap rate of postage is passed on to the subscriber
in a lower subscription price than would otherwise be possible</i>.”</p>

<p>The Hon. Charles Emory Smith truly declared: “Our free institutions rest
on popular intelligence, and it has from the beginning been our fixed and enlightened
policy to foster and promote the general diffusion of public information.
Congress has wisely framed the postal laws with this just and liberal conception.</p>

<p>“It has uniformly sought to encourage intercommunication and the exchange
of intelligence. As facilities have cheapened, it has gradually lowered all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
postage rates. It has never aimed to make the postal service a source of profit,
but simply to make it pay its own way and to give the people the benefit of all
possible advancement.</p>

<p>“In harmony with this sound and judicious policy, it has deliberately
established a low rate of postage for genuine newspapers and periodicals, with the
express design of encouraging and aiding the distribution of the recognized means
and agencies of public information.</p>

<p>“It is not a matter of favor, but of approved judgment. <i>It is not for the
publishers, but for the people.</i>”</p>

<p>The testimony of Senator Bristow is that, “I am glad we have got a one-cent
rate of postage for the legitimate newspapers and magazines of the country, and
I would rather decrease it than raise it. <i>The beneficiaries are the poor people
themselves</i>, who now get daily papers at from $2 to $4 a year, when they used to
pay from $10 to $12. They now get magazines from $1 to $1.50, when they used
to pay $4 to $6 per year for magazines of no higher grade.” …</p>

<p>And I would remind the Commission that there are millions of laboring men
and women who cannot afford to add to their living expenses the cost of any but
the very cheapest reading matter, and many not even that. After buying food
and clothing and providing shelter there is scarcely anything left in the home for
cultivating the intellect and informing the mind.</p>

<p>When sickness intervenes, then comes the stress of debt, and if death follow,
the future has to be drawn upon to give the dead a burial such as love would
provide. Are these people, <i>the bone and sinew of the land, those in the humble
walks of life</i>, not to be considered when it is proposed to add to the cost of the
family reading?</p>

<p>It surely should not be made more difficult for the poor to obtain that which
is so essential to their welfare and that of the Republic of which they form an
important part.…</p>

<p>“But here I cannot forbear to recommend,” said George Washington, in his
message to Congress, on November 6, 1792, “a repeal of the tax on the transportation
of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the
United States as the affections of the people, guided by an enlightened policy;
and to this primary good, nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation
of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States.”</p>

<p class="center">NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.&mdash;THE DIFFERENCE.</p>

<p>An effort was made in the closing hours of the 61st Congress to increase the
postage rate on magazines. It is my opinion that the postage rate should remain
uniform as it is now upon all classes of publications. There should be no partiality
shown, there should be no discrimination. A proposal to increase the rate on
magazines alone, is not one that should have the endorsement of this Commission
nor the approval of Congress, as I shall endeavor to show.</p>

<p>Under Section 432 of the Postal Laws and Regulations, “A newspaper is held
to be a publication regularly issued at stated intervals of not longer than one week;
a periodical is held to be a publication regularly issued at stated intervals less
frequently than weekly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>A magazine is nowhere defined in the Postal Laws and Regulations. A
law that would increase the postage rate on “magazines,” without an explicit
definition of the word, would apply to just such publications as the Postmaster-General
might select in the administration of the law, and none others. No such
power of discrimination should be vested in any official. The Postmaster-General
is an executive, not a judicial officer, nor a lawmaker.</p>

<p>It has been wisely and aptly said that this is a government of laws and not of
men; that there is no arbitrary power located in any individual or body of individuals;
but that all in authority are guided and limited by those provisions
which the people have, through the organic law, declared shall be the measure
and scope of all control exercised over them.</p>

<p>There seems to be no good reason why a newspaper, which is carried in the
mails once a day or once a week, should pay a less rate than a monthly or quarterly.
If the Government really loses money in handling and transporting second-class
matter, the loss would be greater on the former than on the latter, because
a daily goes through the mails 365 times a year, a weekly 52 times, while a monthly
only goes 12 times, and a quarterly 4 times.</p>

<p>We learn from official records that daily newspapers comprise 40.50 per cent.
of all second-class matter, weeklies 15.23 per cent., papers devoted to science 1.30,
to education .64, religious 5.91, trade 4.94, agriculture 5, magazines 20.23, and
miscellaneous 6.25. Note that it is stated that 20.23 of the whole consists of
magazines; but what is a magazine? We are nowhere told, and the percentage
quoted has the appearance of being founded upon conjecture.…</p>

<p>This Commission may not be aware of the fact that the Pennsylvania Railroad
will take, and does take, packages of papers for all of the great newspapers
that are published along its lines, and transports them in the baggage cars for
one-quarter of a cent per pound, to any station on the line, whether it is ten miles
from the place of origin, or 1,000 miles from the place of origin. And yet the
Department is paying the railroads approximately two cents a pound for hauling
the newspapers of the country.</p>

<p>The papers are delivered by the publishers to the train just the same as the
publisher delivers his newspapers to the train when they are sent by mail. These
packages are delivered to the depots of the railroads, and the parties to whom they
are sent call at the depots for the packages. If they are sent by mail the publisher
delivers them at the train, and the parties to whom they are addressed call at the
postoffice for the packages. The postoffice Department does not go to the newspaper
office and get the mail. The publisher delivers the newspapers to the
mail trains, the same as he delivers them to baggage cars for the railroad company.</p>

<p>And possibly the Commission has not been informed that the express companies
have a contract with the American Publishers’ Association whereby they
agree to receive newspaper packages of any size, and deliver them to their destination
within a limit of 500 miles, for one-half cent per pound. The express
company does not call at the newspaper office for the papers. The publisher
delivers them to the express car, the same as he delivers his papers to the mail
car. The express company then takes these newspapers, consisting of packages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of any size, from a single wrapper to a 100-pound bundle, and delivers them at the
other end of the line to the addresses, if the distance is not greater than 500 miles,
for half a cent a pound, and by its contract with the railroad the express company
pays the railroad only a quarter of a cent a pound.</p>

<p>The Department figures show that the average distance which newspapers
are hauled is less than 300 miles. Yet the Department is paying about two cents
a pound to the railroad for that which the express companies pay but a quarter of
a cent a pound. The express companies only charge the publisher one-half cent a
pound, while the Government charges him one cent a pound. The express companies
pay the railways one-fourth a cent a pound, while the Government pays
about two cents&mdash;eight times as much&mdash;for exactly the same service. The
express companies are glad to get the business, and render more service than the
Postoffice Department, because they deliver the packages of any size at the other
end, which the Department does not do.</p>

<p>Senator Bristow is authority for the above statements concerning the railroad
and express contracts.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Now I would not have this (class) newspaper and its annexes deprived of the
low postage rate, but as the Postoffice Department has within the past ten years
denied admission to the mails of 11,563 of other publications, and 32,000 others
have been ruled out or died from the hard conditions imposed, I would respectfully
request this Commission to ascertain and report to the President for transmission
to Congress <i>why there has never been a single publication of this class shut
out or even molested in the slightest degree</i>?</p>

<p>I do not say it is, but <i>is</i> it, because such papers are politically powerful, that
they have the ear of the public, that they hold a monopoly of the news, and that
they can make or unmake the reputation of public officials at will, and that therefore
they are immune from interference?…</p>

<p>I have here a copy of the <i>Police Gazette</i>, which I take to be a superior paper
of its class. It is held to be a newspaper, entitled to transmission through the
mails at a cent a pound. It has never been proposed to raise the postage rate on
this paper.…</p>

<p><i>This Commission should endeavor to find out and report to the President for
transmission to Congress, why the postage rate on one-half of the periodicals devoted
to agriculture should be increased from one cent to three cents, and the postage rate
on the Police Gazette should remain at one cent.</i></p>

<h3>HEARINGS BEFORE THE HUGHES POSTAL COMMISSION.</h3>

<p>I intended to follow the hearings before this commission personally.
Ill health prevented my doing so. Under this stress, I asked
my friend, Mr. M. H. Madden, quoted on a previous page in connection
with other phases of our general subject, to summarize for
me the hearings of the commission in August. Mr. Madden kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
consented to do so. Following is what he writes me relating to the
commission’s proceedings and hearings:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The first meeting of the commission took place on August 1, and it continued
its hearings in New York City, with occasional adjournments during the
greater part of the month.</p>

<p>Postmaster General Hitchcock represented his department before the
commission, Second Assistant Stewart and Third Assistant Britt were also present,
each in turn occupying the stand. Hitchcock outlined his position concerning a
demand for an increase for the first time, although the same idea was expressed
by Third Assistant Britt some months ago, when Britt made an address before a
convention of newspaper circulation managers in Chicago. Hitchcock and his two
assistants held to the view that each schedule in the postal service should be made
self-sustaining, the credit for this idea being given to Hitchcock, and in order to
justify his position concerning a raise in second-class rates an arbitrary figure has
been placed on the cost of handling the same, the total “deficit” from this schedule
being placed at about $70,000,000 annually. This amount was arrived at by
what Second Assistant Postmaster General Stewart states was a complete record
of the weighing of all mail handled by the Postoffice Department of matter
originating in every postoffice and railway postoffice in the country for a period of
six months from July 1 to December 1, 1907, together with the amount of mail
carried in every railway car. The department in many instances has admitted
the unreliability of the figures used, there having been many estimates employed.</p>

<p>Publishers of the country were represented by several attorneys who examined
into the testimony given by Hitchcock, Stewart and Britt, and by a series
of questions they showed that the conclusions of the three as to cost of handling
second-class mail were made on a guesswork plan and not on a scientific or
reasonably accurate basis of fact. Third Assistant Postmaster General Britt
made the startling statement that “if all the magazines and newspapers were
excluded from the second-class rates because of a circulation gained, <i>not on the
merits</i> of the publication, but <i>because of some voting contest or offer of premiums
as a bait, not 10 per cent. of the total would remain undisturbed</i>.”</p>

<p>This declaration was looked upon as an argument by the magazine publishers
as favoring their contention that the advertising portions of their periodicals
are justified by legitimate business reasons, as an increased volume of advertising
enables publishers to issue periodicals of much higher literary excellence.
The postal authorities held with firmness to the conviction that advertising
matter in publications is primarily for the advantage of the publisher, and therefore
should be charged a higher rate than reading matter. Postmaster General
Hitchcock went on record before the commission as declaring that he would
recommend to Congress an increase on the advertising portion of magazines and
newspapers of a cent a pound additional. Assuming that the postoffice officials
are prompted by a legitimate purpose in their desire to increase rates on second-class
matter, their arguments before the commission have been transparently
weak, and an unbiased mind they would fail in convincing, but the feeling is
that the commission will accept the conclusions of the postal authorities that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the government rate of one cent a pound is inadequate for transporting second-class
matter. To justify the position taken by the government that each schedule
should maintain itself, the Postmaster General intends to press with vigor a reduction
of first-class postage from two-cents to one cent a letter, he citing the
profit on first-class mail and the alleged loss on second-class matter as his reason
for the change of rate.</p>

<p>Religious and denominational publications were represented before the
commission, the contention being made by these that the doubling of the rate on
second-class matter would work very serious injury to the religious press, forcing
many publications out of business. This statement was made by E. R. Graham,
representing the Methodist Book Concern publications in Cincinnati and New
York, and seemingly it made an impression on the members of the commission.
The attorneys representing the publishers were much interested in Mr. Graham’s
statement, he being considered a competent authority on the matter.</p>

<p>One of the strongest arguments of the hearings, because of the experience
which he has had as a postal official, was made by Mr. W. S. Shallenberger, who
had served several years in Congress as a member of the Committee on Postoffice
and Postroads. Mr. Shallenberger was for a number of years Second Assistant
Postmaster General, and now represents the Interdenominational Publishers
who issue Sunday school literature throughout the United States. This witness
gave it as his opinion that an increase in the rate on second-class matter would
cause magazines and newspapers to avail themselves of the facilities now offered
by the express companies which are becoming active competitors of the government
in transporting second-class matter, these corporations obtaining better
rates from the railroads than is given to the government. Mr. Shallenberger
expressed the view that since every civilized nation was cheapening the cost of
postal service the fact that our country was seeking to increase the rate seemed
to be reactionary.</p>

<p>Mr. Shallenberger served under six Postmaster Generals and all of these held
that the government was carrying second-class matter at a loss. But his opinion
was that there was a substantial profit in the present rate, at the same time
condemning the idea that each particular schedule should be made to pay its own
way, the stimulus toward encouraging other schedule receipts not being given its
proper consideration. Mr. Shallenberger gave a hint concerning hidden influences
seeking to have the second-class rate increased but did not enter deeply into this
phase of the subject. The controversy between Mr. Shallenberger and Second
Assistant Stewart was animated and prolonged, and touched on features connected
with the compensation paid railroads for hauling the mail, the express companies
getting better terms than the government, this statement being made by a representative
of the Postal Progress League.</p>

<p>The strongest point the publishing interests made was when the superintendent
of the railway mail service, Chas. H. McBride, testified that a considerable
part of the estimate upon which the department’s figures are based is
guesswork and assumption, he admitting that if this were so the result would not
be greatly different from what the officials first claimed. On the whole Superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
McBride’s testimony was calculated to show that the Postoffice Department
was desirous of making out a case against the second-class schedule, however
necessary it was to twist figures and conceal facts in order to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilmer Atkinson, publisher of Farm Journal, Philadelphia, combated
the contention of the postoffice officials, as shown in their statements and tables,
and declared with much emphasis that second-class matter stimulated first-class
postage receipts. The statement of the cost of carrying second-class matter,
placing it at nine cents a pound, is, according to him, “only a stereotyped guess
that goes into the postoffice department report, each year,” experts having repeatedly
stated that there is no possible way of fixing the cost of carrying second-class
mail. In the opinion of Mr. Atkinson the government could better afford
to carry it free than not to carry it at all. “Gumption and common sense,”
declared Mr. Atkinson, “should rather be applied than indulging in worthless
guessing.”</p>

<p>Representatives of scientific publications, college journals, fashion papers,
fraternal societies and trade periodicals appeared before the members of the
commission during the sessions, and all entered emphatic protests against the
increase. In numerous instances these interests made the statement that serious
reverses would be encountered if the postage rate should be doubled, and that
many publications would be forced to suspend.</p>

<p>The labor union press, an interest representing about 250 weekly and
monthly publications, with a circulation approximating 1,250,000 copies was
officially represented by President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor, and President Matthew Woll, of the Photo-Engravers’ Union. Mr.
Gompers entered vigorous protests against discriminations against labor publications
and registered a severe censure of the method by which the Postoffice
Department had hampered the official journals of the labor people. Mr. Gompers
stated that the publications of the American Federation of Labor and its auxiliaries
were all highly educational in their character and, in the event of an increase
in the item of postage to the extent of 100 per cent additional, many of the
best would be driven out of business with corresponding loss to the men individually
and to the nation as a whole. Mr. Gompers’ declaration was listened to
with much interest.</p>

<p>President Woll dwelt on the far-reaching effect which the hampering of the
labor press would have on the manifold business relationships involved in the
printing industry, primarily directing attention to the more than a third of a
million of workers in the printing trades alone. He then advanced to the foundation
of the paper and machinery features of the proposition, viz., from the ore in
the mine, from which the machinery was made, to the forest tree from which the
pulp is ground. The tonnage of the transportation service of the country would
at once be doubly interfered with, first in a reduced demand for material with
which to make the paper and, secondly, the corresponding decrease in the weight
of the finished product of the publications. In many features Mr. Woll made
prominent the ideas which the “Postal Riders and Raiders” is promoting, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the educational features of the immense volume of printing which comes
from the printing press in all sections of the country.</p>

<p>The commission adjourned, subject to the call of Justice Hughes. However,
it is understood that it will be called together in time to prepare its report to
President Taft and to Congress when the session opens in December, 1911.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Mr. Hitchcock, it should be noted, is careful in giving the higher per cent. of rate
which the third and fourth classes show above the second class rate. Beyond the bare
statement that the expense of handling second class matter “is less” than for other classes,
he says nothing of cost of carriage and handling. His own figures show (see preceding
paragraph), that the cost of carriage and handling first-class matter is 422 per cent. higher
than his own absurd cost-figure of 9 cents a pound (cost) for carriage and handling second-class
and <i>4600 per cent. higher than the present second class rate</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Mr. Suter must certainly have been wind-jamming a little. “Every man, woman and
child” pays at a maximum rate of 2 cents an ounce or fraction thereof. That is at the rate
of 32 cents a pound. Mr. Hitchcock’s figures assert, that it costs “47 cents a pound”
to carry and handle the letters for “every man, woman and child”&mdash;that is, presuming they
all write letters. The letter writers, it appears then, pay only 2 cents for a service which
costs nearly 3 cents.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">POSTAL DEFICITS.</span></h2>

<p>Now, let us look into and over that postoffice “deficit,” to the
origin of which the memory of man scarcely runneth back, and which
Mr. Hitchcock, by some strenuous effort on <i>right</i> lines readily converted
into a surplus&mdash;a $6,000,000 deficit into some hundreds of
thousands of dollars surplus. The returns are not all in yet. At
any rate the Postmaster General has not announced them loud
enough for The Man on the Ladder to hear, or he was in his physician’s
hands when the announcement was made.</p>

<p>However that may be, Mr. Hitchcock has proved quite conclusively
that there is no deficit&mdash;or, at least, no valid reason for one
under present conditions.</p>

<p>And here, again, I desire to say that our present Postmaster
General is deserving the praise or commendation of every American
citizen for having demonstrated, by a few economies here and a
few betterments there in the operation of his department, that the
service <i>can</i> be rendered, and rendered efficiently, with an expenditure
safely within the bounds of the department’s receipts or revenues.</p>

<p>Especially is Mr. Hitchcock deserving of commendation for this
demonstration, because in making it he has done what so many of
his predecessors <i>talked of as desirable</i>, but failed to do.</p>

<p>But with full acknowledgment of the splendid effort Mr. Hitchcock
has made in converting a postal deficit of $6,000,000 in 1909-10
into a surplus for the year 1910-11, I desire to discuss, briefly, postal
department deficits of the past&mdash;or the future&mdash;and the origin and
cause of them.</p>

<p>In the future pages of this volume little if any reference will be
made to our vigorous Postmaster General’s attempt to put onto the
Senate course a rider that would run down certain periodicals which
were to him and certain of his friends, as it would appear, of obstructive
if not offensive character. It is possible, if, indeed, not
probable, that I may, in this somewhat hurried discussion of our
Postoffice Department deficits and their sources, cause and origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
repeat something, in whole or in part, that I have said elsewhere in
this volume.</p>

<p>The discussion of the postal deficits leads us into the <i>Raider</i>
factor or feature of our general title&mdash;into a consideration of the
political, partisan and business influences and interests which have for
thirty-five or more years been conspicuously&mdash;yes, <i>brazenly</i>&mdash;looting
the revenues of the department. I shall not be able to advert to all
such influences, interests and persons. Especially can I not mention
some of the <i>persons</i>. Many of them have gone to “their reward”&mdash;or
to their punishment&mdash;as the Almighty has seen fit to assign them.
As a matter of venerable custom and of current conventional courtesy
we must leave them to His justice&mdash;to our silence. One by one many
of the <i>dishonestly enriched</i> from our postal revenues have dropped into
“the dead past,” which Christ instructed should be left to “bury its
dead.” In our treatment of this subject we shall obey the Master’s
instruction&mdash;we shall discuss methods, practices, and <i>acts</i>, not men.</p>

<p>In turning to our subject directly, I desire to make a few positive
statements or declarations.</p>

<p>1. The Postoffice Department is a public service department&mdash;a
department intended to serve <i>all the people all the time</i>.</p>

<p>2. The people are paying, have paid, and are <i>willing to pay</i>, for
their postal service.</p>

<p>3. The people do not care&mdash;never have cared&mdash;whether the
expenditures exceed the receipts by $6,000,000 or $100,000,000, <i>if
they get the service for the money expended</i>.</p>

<p>In comment on the last, I wish here to ask if anyone has heard
much loud noise from the people about the army and the navy
expenditures&mdash;<i>expenditures larger than that of any other nation on
earth</i> for similar purposes?</p>

<p>Yet, for twenty or more years, the people have paid the appropriations
for&mdash;also met the “deficit” bills of&mdash;each of those departments
without any noticeable “holler.”</p>

<p>But, again, it must be pertinently asked, what have the people
received in return for their <i>billions</i> of expenditures for those two
departments?</p>

<p>Yes, what? They have had the doubtful “glory” of having
their army <i>debauch</i> some island possessions, maneuver for local
entertainments and do some society stunts while on “post leave”&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
“leave”, for epauletted military officers, appears to have occupied
most of their time.</p>

<p>And the people have put up, ungrumblingly, $100,000,000 to
$150,000,000 or more (I forget the figures), for a navy&mdash;a navy
carrying on its payrolls more “shore leave” men and clerks than it
has service men. (At any rate that was the showing in a recent year).
For this vast expenditure of their money the people got&mdash;<i>got what</i>?</p>

<p>Well, for their hundreds of millions expenditure on that navy of
ours, the people, to date, have received in return <i>newspaper reports</i> of
numerous magazine and gun explosions with, of course, a list of the
killed and wounded, and reports of “blow-hole” or otherwise faulted
armor plate, turrets, etc., of raising “The Maine,” of shoaling this,
that or the other battleship, or of “sparring” or “lightering” off, to the
music that is made by a “blow-in” of fifty thousand to two or three
hundred thousand more of their money.</p>

<p>Reader, if you read&mdash;if you have read&mdash;the “news”&mdash;the
periodical literature&mdash;of those past twenty years, you will know that
the people have received little or no returns for the vast expenditure
of money&mdash;of <i>their</i> money&mdash;that their representatives (?) have made
for the Navy Department.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I remember that our army and navy fought to a
“victorious” conclusion the “Spanish American” war.</p>

<p>No patriotic American citizen alive at the time that war occurred
will ever forget it. He will ever remember Siboney, Camp Thomas,
Camp Wycoff, and the cattle-ship transports for diseased and dying
soldiers. He will also remember the “embalmed beef” and the
“decayed tack” and other contracts and contractors.</p>

<p>If the patriotic citizen has been an “old soldier,” or is familiar
with the history of wars, he will also know that, if the whole land
fighting of that Spanish American war was corralled into <i>one</i> action
that action would be infinitely less sanguine than was the action at a
number of “skirmishes” in our civil war&mdash;that, if the several naval
actions of that war were merged into one, it would not equal, in
either gore or naval glory, Farragut’s capture of Mobile, the action in
Hampton Roads, nor even Perry’s scrimmage on Lake Erie in 1813.</p>

<p>What has all this to do with the postal department deficit, some
one may ask? It has just this to do with it:</p>

<p>If a people stand unmurmuringly for the expenditure of <i>billions</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for a service that yields them no return, save a protection <i>they have
not needed</i> and of doubtful security if needed, that people is not
going to raise any noisy hubbub over a dinky deficit of a few millions
a year for a service which should serve them <i>every day of every year</i>.</p>

<p>I have expanded a little, not disgressed, in writing to my
statement numbered 3. I will now proceed with my premeditated
statements. Some of them may be a little frigid, but none of them
are cold-storage. Some one may have told it all to you before, but
that is his fault, not mine. He merely beat me to the <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>4. As stated in a forward page of this volume, the people of this
nation want and demand <i>service</i> of its Postoffice Department. They
care not to the extent of a halloween pea-shooter whether the service
is rendered at a deficit of six million or at a surplus of ten million, <i>if
service is rendered for the money expended</i>.</p>

<p>5. The people of this country will object more strenuously
against a <i>surplus</i> in their postal revenues&mdash;their service tax&mdash;than
they ever have or will object to a deficit in the revenues of that service,
<i>if they get the service</i>.</p>

<p>6. The Postoffice Department is not understood&mdash;is not even
thought of by intelligent citizens&mdash;as a <i>revenue-producing</i> department.
It <i>is</i> understood to be a <i>service</i> department, and the citizen&mdash;His
Majesty, the American Citizen&mdash;is always willing to pay for
services rendered.</p>

<p>7. The Postoffice Department has not in the period named&mdash;no,
not for thirty or thirty-five years&mdash;<i>rendered the citizen the service for
which he paid</i>.</p>

<p>I mean by that, of course, that the citizen has been compelled
to pay far more for a postal service than he <i>should have paid for that
service</i>.</p>

<p>8. Had that service been <i>honestly, faithfully and efficiently
rendered</i>, the price the citizen has paid for it <i>would have left no deficit
for any year within the past thirty</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>The only deficits in those thirty or thirty-five years have been
the result of manipulated bookkeeping, of political trenching into the
revenues of the department, of loose methods in its management, of
disinterest in the enforcement of even loose methods, and of downright
lootage and stealings.</i></p>

<p>“Rather harsh that, is it not?” asks one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mere assertion,” says another</p>

<p>To the first I need only say that this is an age not congenial to
milk-poultice talk. I have previously expressed my opinion on that
point. If you have a thing to say, say it <i>hard</i>. The majority of
people will then understand you. Those who do not understand you
can continue their milk poultices&mdash;or believe and talk as they are told
<i>or are paid to believe and talk</i>.</p>

<p>The latter&mdash;the reader who yodles that my preceding nine
statements appear to be assertions only&mdash;can make a courteous and,
possibly, a profitable use of an hour’s leisure in reading a few following
pages, before he <i>rusts</i> into the belief that those nine “assertions”
are groundless assertions.</p>

<p>In showing that there is no “deficit”&mdash;a shortage of receipts in
the Postoffice Department over its legitimate expenditures&mdash;I shall
not take my nine statements up seriatim, but present my reasons in
a general way for having made such blunt declarations. I may go
about that, too, in an awkward way, but the reader who follows me
will get my reasons for making those nine declarations.</p>

<h3>NO CREDIT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES RENDERED OTHER DEPARTMENTS.</h3>

<p>If the department of public works in Chicago does a piece of
bricklaying, concrete or other construction work for the police, fire,
health or other department of the city government, or if it carts or
hauls away some excavated material or razed debris for any of those
other departments, the service rendered is made a <i>charge</i> by the
department of public works <i>against</i> the department for which the
service is rendered.</p>

<p>What is true in this instance in Chicago’s municipal government
is true of every other city or incorporated town in this country that
has its service departmentized.</p>

<p>If the County Commissioners of McCrackin county build a bridge
or culvert for Ridgepole township in the county the cost of constructing
that bridge or culvert (or a proportional share of it, if on a
general highway), is made a charge against Ridgepole township.</p>

<p>If the transportation department of the United States Steel
Corporation delivers the services of three steam tugs (services rated
at $30.00 per day) to the corporation’s smelting or rail departments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
there is a credit of $90.00 given to the transportation department,
and a corresponding <i>charge made against the department for which the
service is rendered, for each day’s service rendered</i>.</p>

<p><i>That states a recognized business rule and practice</i> among both
private and public corporations. Its valid and <i>just</i> purpose is to
prevent the loading upon one department (any one department) the
expenses created or incurred by another.</p>

<p>Is it not a valid, fair and just method of business?</p>

<p>If it is not, then the largest merchants, the most productive and
profitable manufacturing establishments, transportation companies,
banking and other mercantile, industrial and financial institutions
have not discovered the fact.</p>

<p>If the owner of an Egyptian hen ranch had a shrinkage in his
castor bean crop, he would not think of charging the cost or loss on
those castor beans up to his hens, would he? Hens do not eat castor
beans. That is useless&mdash;well&mdash;yes, of course. Well, hens do not eat
castor beans, anyway. So my ill-chosen illustration, though may
stand&mdash;stand anyway until someone finds a breed of hens which likes
castor beans.</p>

<p>But, if the hens of that hen-rancher invaded his vegetable garden,
scratched up his set onions and seeded radishes, pecked holes in three
hundred heads of his “early” cabbage and otherwise damaged the
fruits of his labor, care and hopes&mdash;likewise disarranged his figures
on prospective profits&mdash;if the hens did that, that hen-rancher would
most certainly charge his loss to the hens, would he not?</p>

<p>That is, he would do so, if the hens had attended to their legitimate
business as industriously as they looked after his vegetable
garden and, by reason of that legitimate effort, showed a “profit
balance.” The preceding is based, of course, on the assumption
that the rancher has acumen enough to distinguish a hen from a
rooster and a sunflower from a cauliflower. If he is so wised up,
whether by experience and observation or by academic training, he
will most certainly charge his loss on vegetables against those hens.</p>

<p>“What is the application of all this to the Postoffice Department
deficits?” some one is justified in asking.</p>

<p>Well, my intended application of it is, first, to show a generally
recognized and practical business method&mdash;a business method practiced
by both public and private corporations and by individuals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
firms, from the hen-rancher to the department store. My second
purpose is to show that this almost universally recognized business
method has been and is <i>totally ignored in conducting the vast service
affairs</i> of the Federal Postoffice Department.</p>

<h3>FREE-IN-COUNTY MATTER.</h3>

<p>The 1910 report of the Postoffice Department states that 55,639,177
pounds of second-class mail was carried and distributed <i>free</i> in
the counties of these United States.</p>

<p>Of course, this 1910 <i>gift</i> to country publishers is the result of a
moss-grown custom&mdash;a custom born of an ingrown desire common to
crooked politicians&mdash;a desire to trade the general public service for
<i>private</i> service. All the second, third and fourth class cities in the
country, as well as a majority of our towns and larger incorporated
villages, have their <i>party</i> newspaper or newspapers.</p>

<p>Comparatively speaking, few of them have any extensive telegraphic
service, if any at all, in the gathering of news. Those which
have not, capture the early morning editions&mdash;or the late evening
editions of the day before&mdash;of two or more metropolitan papers,
“crib” their “news” and deliberately run it, in many instances, as
special wires to their own sheets. In some cases, which I have
personally noticed, that practice was indulged when their own
“newspaper” consisted of but two to four locally printed pages
reinforced by a “patent inside.” Why should such newspapers (?)
be given “free distribution” in the county of publication?</p>

<p>They contain little if any real news and less matter of any real
informative or educational value. True, the most of them do publish
a “local” column or half column of “news” for each or for several of
the outlying villages in the county of publication. These “local
news” columns inform the reader that “Mr. Benjamin Peewee circulated
in Boneville on Wednesday last;” that “Mrs. Cornstalk and her
daughter Lizzie are spending the week at the old homestead, just
south of town,” that “Mr. Frank Suds shipped a fine load of hogs
from Bensonville on Friday of this week,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Most edifying “news” that, is it not? So didactic and brain-building,
is it not?</p>

<p>Now, why should the Postoffice Department carry those millions
of pounds of Reubenville sheets <i>free</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The department report says it carried about 56,000,000 pounds
of such “periodicals” free last year. The figures for this year (1910-11)
will probably be around 60,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Why should the department give away $600,000 in revenues?</p>

<p>Besides that, <i>the department does not know how much of this</i> “free
in county” matter it does carry and distribute. Of course, it may
be able to make a more dependable <i>guess</i> at the total tonnage of such
second-class matter than can I. However, any one who has been
around the “county seat” or the “metropolis” of any of the “hill” or
“back” counties during a county, state or national canvass for votes
will know that the postmaster’s scales are often sadly out of balance
when he weighs into circulation the local newspaper. In fact, it
frequently happens that he does not weigh it at all&mdash;especially not,
if it be an extra or extra large edition issued “for the good of the
party”&mdash;and more especially not, if the edition is issued to serve <i>his</i>
party.</p>

<p>“It goes free anyway, so what is the difference?” the postmaster
may argue, and with fairly valid grounds for such argument. The
department, acting, pursuant of law, says “carry and distribute your
local papers <i>free</i> inside your county.” So what difference does a few
hundred or a few thousand pounds, more or less, make to the department?</p>

<p>Why, certainly, what difference can it make? It is all done for
“the good of the party,” is it not?</p>

<p>This condition, governing, as I personally know it does govern,
furnishes my chief reason for saying that the Postoffice Department
does <i>not</i> know&mdash;does not know even approximately&mdash;the tonnage of
the “free in county” matter it handles. It never has known and does
not <i>now</i> know, within <i>millions</i> of pounds, the weight of such matter it
carries and distributes.</p>

<p>Again, I ask, why is this vast burden thrown onto the department
and the department getting not a cent of either pay or credit for
carrying it? Is it because of a paternal feeling our federal government
has for the poor, benighted farmers of the country? I can
scarcely believe it is. The farmers of this country are neither poor
nor are they benighted. If they were, free carriage and distribution
to them of these local sheets has not enriched them to any appreciable
extent, however much such free carriage and delivery may have added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to the bank accounts of the publishers of such periodical literature.
Besides, ninety-five in every hundred farmers whose names
are on the publishers’ subscription books <i>pay their subscriptions</i>.
They usually pay, too, a pretty stiff rate&mdash;$1.50 or $2.00 for a
“weekly,” which gives them mostly borrowed news and much of it
decidedly stale at that. If a beneficent government grants its “free
in county” postal regulation with a view to dissipating the gloom
which clogs the garrets of our “benighted farmers,” that government
misses its purpose on two essential points. Our farmers, as previously
intimated, are no more benighted than are the residents of our
villages, towns and cities, and even if their ignorance was as dense as
a “practical” politician’s conscience, the medium which the Government
delivers to them, carriage free, seldom contributes much enlightenment.</p>

<p>No, it was not for either the enrichment or the enlightenment of
the dear farmer that the present “free in county” postal regulation
was made operative. It was to give some local party henchman a
fairly profitable job as publisher of a county newspaper&mdash;a party
newspaper&mdash;and to have, in him, a county “heeler” who would divide
his time between building the party fences and telling the dear farmer
how to vote.</p>

<p>It is due to the publishers of country newspapers to say, that
hundreds of them have grown away from rigid party ties&mdash;have
grown independent. It is also but just to say that as these publishers
have grown independent of party domination, their newspapers have
improved. We have now many most excellent country papers
published in our “down state” cities and larger towns.</p>

<p>The points I desire to make, however, are, first, the “free in
county” mail delivery regulation was originally adopted for partisan
political purposes, not to serve the farmer residents of the counties,
and, second, that such regulation is unjustly discriminating and is
raiding the service earnings of the Postoffice Department to the extent
of at least six hundred thousand dollars annually. In my opinion
such raiding will reach seven or eight hundred thousands a year.</p>

<h3>FRANKED AND PENALTY MATTER.</h3>

<p>Going back now to that generally recognized and practical
business method referred to and which the government persistently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
refuses or neglects to adopt in handling and directing the fiscal
affairs of its Postoffice Department, we find another raid on that
department’s revenues.</p>

<p>Third Assistant Postmaster General, James J. Britt, makes a sort
of estimate of the amount of free second-class matter of Government
origin the Postoffice Department transported and distributed during
the fiscal year ended, June 30, 1910. Mr. Britt places the figure at
50,120,884 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Britt’s estimate is based on a six months’ weighing period in
1907 (the last half of that year.) It is reported as a “special weighing”
and showed 26,578,047 pounds of “free in county” second-class
matter and 23,941,782 pounds of free franked and penalty matter of
the second-class. Mr. Britt then proceeds (page 335 of the department
report for 1910), to arrive at his estimated tonnage of franked
and penalty matter by assuming that the weight ratio of such second-class
matter to “free in county” matter would be about the same for
1910. He says: “If, as it seems reasonable to believe, the relative
proportions of this character of matter have remained the same,”
there would result for the fiscal year 1909-10 the figures he gives for
the franked and penalty tonnage, or 50,120,884 pounds.</p>

<p>Well, to The Man on the Ladder it does <i>not</i> seem “reasonable
to believe” that such method of estimating is sound nor the tonnage
result attained by it dependable. The year 1907 was a decidedly off-year
in franked matter of the second-class. The then President kept
most of the Senators and Congressmen guessing as to just what he
intended to do in the matter of the presidential nomination of his
party. In fact, he kept a goodly number of federal legislators
guessing on that point until well along in 1908. The result of this
condition of doubt was greatly to lessen the franked mailings and also
reduced in material degree the mailing of departmental, or “penalty”
matter of the second-class.</p>

<p>For this and several other reasons, the tonnage of franked and
penalty matter reported as carried in the last half of 1907&mdash;even if
the “special weighing” Mr. Britt mentions was accurate and dependable,
which it <i>was</i> not and could not be, either then or now, under the
lax methods by which such weighings were and are made&mdash;the reported
weight of such franked and penalty matter carried in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
half of 1907 furnishes no fair or safe basis upon which to predicate
1910 totals or to base a dependable estimate of them.</p>

<p>Another defective factor is used in Mr. Britt’s estimate&mdash;the
reported total weight of “free in county” second-class matter as
ascertained by special weighing in the last half of 1907. As previously
stated in discussing the raid of six to eight hundred thousand
dollars a year made upon the postal service revenues by this “free in
county” matter, the department’s reported figures for it are little
more than a robust <i>guess</i> at its tonnage, even now, and the figures
given for 1907 are much less trustworthy than are the department’s
estimates and guesses for the fiscal year ended in 1910. Whatever
may be said of its faults and faulty purposes, it is but simple justice
to say the present departmental administration has shown more
judgment and activity and has put forth more strenuous effort to get
to the bottom of things and at dependable facts in mail weights than
has been shown by any of its recent predecessors.</p>

<p>Still, I repeat that its reported figures for the total tonnage
of “free in county” for carriage and delivery of second-class mail
matter are not sufficiently reliable to warrant their use as a basis
for making a dependable estimate of the tonnage of another free
division of second class mail. Especially unreliable are the figures
reported as total tonnage of free-in-county-matter as a basis for
estimating the tonnage of a division of the service so far removed
from “free in county” as is that of free franked and penalty matter.</p>

<p>All that aside, however, the fact is the Postoffice Department
should receive credit for every pound of franked or penalty matter it
handles for the legislative and other departments of the government
service.</p>

<p>Mr. Britt himself appears to recognize the force of that fact. On
page 335 of the department report for 1910, he speaks as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The public mind seems unusually acute on the subject of free mailing facilities,
and there is much criticism in the public press of the continuance of the
franking privilege and the use of the penalty envelope, the suggestion being often
made that the same should be abolished and that this department should receive
proper credit in accounting for matter now being carried free. It is therefore suggested
that consideration be given to the desirability of eliminating the transportation
of mail matter under frank or penalty clause, in order that the Postoffice
Department may receive due and proper credit for the tremendous, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
part possibly unnecessary, services which it is performing free, to its apparent
financial embarrassment.</p>

<p>It is probably true that the use of the penalty envelope and the franking
privilege is availed of with undue liberality, even if not actually abused, as is
often alleged; that is to say, the same care is not taken to confine the mailings of
governmental and congressional matter to only that which is necessary as would
undoubtedly be the case if there were a strict accountability for their use.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be noted that Mr. Britt in the foregoing covers other than
second-class mail matter. Taking the figures of his estimate of the
volume of free franked and penalty matter of the second-class (51,000,000
pounds in round numbers, which I believe is so conservative
as to be far below the actual tonnage), then the various other departments
of the government are raiding the revenues of the Postoffice
Department to the extent of $510,000 for the carrying and handling
of their second-class mail alone. That is, they are requiring the Postoffice
Department to render to them without pay or credit over a half-million
dollars’ worth of service a year. That is figured at the 2nd class
rate of 1 cent a pound. If Mr. Britt’s own estimate, on another
page of the same report, that it cost the Postoffice Department 9
cents a pound to transport and handle second-class mail, is correct,
which as previously shown it is not, then other departments of the
government would be raiding the postal service revenues&mdash;revenues
which private individuals, firms, corporations and governments
subordinate, now alone pay&mdash;to the extent of more than $4,500,000 a
year.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind by the reader, however, that Mr. Britt’s
estimate of 51,000,000 pounds (a round figure) of second-class matter
carried and handled free by his department for other departments of
the federal government does not represent the total of service
rendered those other departments for which the Postoffice Department
received neither pay nor credit. Far from it.</p>

<p>Hundreds of tons&mdash;how many hundreds of tons, I do not know,
nor have I been able to find an authority or record to inform myself&mdash;of
letters and other sealed matter were carried and distributed by the
Postoffice Department for other departments. For that service not
a cent in pay or credit was received.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the service rate for carrying and
handling the class of matter (first-class) we are here speaking of is 2
cents per ounce or fraction thereof. That is, the rate is not less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
32 cents a pound, not 1 cent a pound as is the rate on second class on
which Mr. Britt gives his estimate of tonnage carried.</p>

<p>Why should not the Senate and the House, the Judicial, War,
Navy, Interior and other departments of the government be required
to provide in their annual appropriation bills for paying for the first-class
service furnished them by the Postoffice Department?</p>

<p>The postal service of the government is also rendered free to the
several departments to handle all their third and fourth class mail
matter. What the annual tonnage of these two classes aggregates I
have been unable to learn. Whether or not the Postoffice Department
keeps any records showing the aggregate mailings by the other
departments, I do not know. I do know, however, that it gets neither
pay nor credit for transporting and handling the third and fourth class
matter put to mail by the other departments of the Federal Government.
That the total weight mailed must run into many hundreds
of tons yearly for each of the classes named there can be little grounds
for doubt or question, records or no records.</p>

<p>The mailing rate on third-class is eight cents a pound. On
fourth-class it is sixteen cents a pound. Those are the rates the
people have to pay. That both rates are outrageously excessive is
well known to every one who has made even a cursory study of the
cost of transporting and handling government mails, and the irony
of it all is the stock arguments put up by postoffice and other federal
officials to justify such outrageous rates.</p>

<p>“The rates are necessary to make the Postoffice Department self-supporting&mdash;to
avoid a deficit,” or statements of similar washed out
force and import. And that in face of the fact that the government
permits its departments, bureaus, divisions, “commissions,” etc., to
raid the postal revenues by loading upon the postal service the cost
of transporting and distributing thousands of tons of mail matter
for which it gets not a cent of pay or credit.</p>

<p>Nice business methods or practice that, is it not?</p>

<p>Beautiful “argument,” this prattle about deficits in the postal
revenues, is it not?</p>

<p>Why, it is humorous enough to make empty headed fools laugh
and sensible men use language which postal regulations bar from the
mails.</p>

<p>Think of the tons upon tons of official reports, of the bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
volumes of the Congressional Record, of copies of the Supreme
Courts rulings and other printed books and pamphlets distributed by
the Departments of War, Navy, Agriculture, Interior and others.</p>

<p>All these fall into the third-class, or 8-cent-a-pound rate.</p>

<p>Think of the tons upon tons of seeds&mdash;farm, garden and flower&mdash;sent
by Congressmen to their constituents&mdash;to thousands of constituents
who do not need the seeds, in fact, who can make no possible use
of them; of the tons upon tons of clothing, suitings, household bric-a-brac,
etc., franked by Senators and Congressmen to their homes, to
their wives, children, sweethearts or friends.</p>

<p>Investigations in the past have shown that hundreds of typewriters,
office desks, even articles of household furniture, were sent
home under frank.</p>

<p>It was also shown in several instances, if I remember rightly, that
some of the typewriters, etc., were never franked back to government
possession. However that may be, all such mailings are of the fourth
class and fall into the 16-cent a pound rate for carriage and handling.</p>

<p>Let us here foot up the amount of the raidings on the postal
funds, so far as we have gone.</p>

<p>First,&mdash;There is the free-in-county second-class&mdash;$600,000 to
$800,000.</p>

<p>Second,&mdash;There is the free second-class franked and penalty
matter. Third Assistant Postmaster General Britt “estimates” it at
$510,000, figured at the present one-cent rate. I have shown the
weakness of Mr. Britt’s <i>basis</i> of estimate. In my judgment the
tonnage of franked and penalty second-class mail is nearer 75,000,000
pounds than his estimate of 51,000,000 pounds. But to take Mr.
Britt’s figures, there is another raid of $510,000 on the service revenues
of the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>Next, we have the free <i>first</i>, <i>third</i> and <i>fourth</i> class matter which
the postal service handles under franking or penalty regulations.</p>

<p>How much does this raid total? How much has and <i>does</i> this
raid contribute toward the creation of that “deficit” which has so
long, so continuously and so <i>brazenly</i> been used to bubble the people
in politico-postal oratory and writing?</p>

<p>The reader must keep in mind that we are here asking about the
thirty-two, the eight and the sixteen cents a pound classes of mail.
To what extent have the various departments of the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
raided the postal funds by taxing the postal service with their over-load
of the character indicated? That they have taxed the Postoffice
Department’s revenues by demanding of that department its
highest class and highest rated service in <i>unlimited</i> degree, and that,
too, without <i>one cent of compensation, pay or credit</i>, is a fact which no
informed man will attempt to controvert.</p>

<p>But what did such service (and abuse of service) cost the
Postoffice Department? To what extent did and <i>does</i> this “frank
and penalty” <i>privilege</i> in first, third and fourth class use of the mails
loot or raid the postal revenues?</p>

<p>Is it to the extent of three, two or one million dollars? Is it lower
than the lowest or higher than the highest figures just named?</p>

<p>I do not know&mdash;do you? Have you, the reader, been able to
ascertain from the records of the Postoffice Department, or elsewhere,
any figures or data that enables you to make even a “frazzled” guess
at the <i>approximate</i> cost to the postal department of this unjust&mdash;<i>this
politically and governmentally crooked</i> burden put upon it?</p>

<p>I have hunted and have found nothing but talk, and a few figures
scattered here and there and gathered from&mdash;well, the Lord may
know where. But the Lord has failed to inform me. So I am in
ignorance&mdash;am benighted, just like our “poor farmers,” both as to the
source of the figures I have seen and as to their force and value in
reaching a fair conclusion as to the aggregate amount of postal revenues
the departmental raiders have been and <i>are</i> carrying off. If any
reader knows or can dig up the facts, he will confer a great favor by
handing the information to The Man on the Ladder. Not only that,
but I am confident that the people of this country will give such
reader a niche, if needed not a conspicuous position, in <i>their</i> Hall of
Fame, if he will give them even a dependable approximation of the
extent to which the postal service revenues are raided&mdash;looted&mdash;by
federal department abuses&mdash;<i>their service and their money</i>, for the departments
pay not <i>one dollar</i> for the thousands of tons of mail matter
of the various classes which the Postoffice Department transports and
handles for them.</p>

<p>So far or so long has this departmental&mdash;<i>bureaucratic</i>, that is what
it is&mdash;practice of raiding the postal revenues by <i>loading its service</i>
continued, that the Postoffice Department has been and is <i>looting
itself by the same practice</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>This volume is written during what is known as the “weighing
period” in the postal service, the weighing being done to establish a
basis for <i>four years</i> on which the railroads transporting the federal
mails shall be paid. In other words, as basis for a “railway-mail-pay”
rate, which rate will govern railway contracts for carrying the
mails for a period of four years.</p>

<p>During the current weighing period I have, at various times, both
during the day and at night, watched the weighing for varying intervals
of from an hour to two hours. Among the revenue raids observed
during those hours of leisure (?), I shall here mention a few.
As the present Postmaster General treats all departmental, or “penalty,”
matter as “franked” matter (See page 11 of the Postoffice
Department report of 1910), I shall, in the brief mention of personally
observed facts at several railway stations in Chicago do likewise.</p>

<p>(1) Three carloads of Senate speeches, franked to Chicago in
bulk, the bulk then broken and the speeches remailed, under frank,
to individual addresses.</p>

<p>I do not know the tonnage of those three cars. Local newspaper
reports stated that there were 3,000,000 copies of one of the
speeches. I take it that sixty tons is a low figure for the three carloads.
The actual weight was probably nearer ninety tons. But
leave it at sixty, the remailing in piece at bulk destination makes
the weight 120 tons on which the Post office Department had to pay
transportation, on sixty tons of which it also had to stand the expense
of piece handling.</p>

<p>(2) Another carload of Senatorial vocal effort passed through
Chicago to a destination far west. I do not know, but presume it was
in bulk, and on arrival, bulk was broken and the matter returned to
mail for piece distribution.</p>

<p>The reader must not overlook the fact that the character of matter
carried in those four carloads was third-class&mdash;was <i>eight-cent-a-pound
matter</i>. There were eighty tons or more of it in bulk and its remailing
in piece would make it 160 tons.</p>

<p>If a manufacturer, merchant or other business man put to mail
160 tons of third-class matter he would contribute to the postal
service revenue just $25,600.</p>

<p>(3) Three crates of fruit went into a mail car at one time, two
cases of canned goods at another and a crate of tomatoes at another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
without passing over the weighing scale. A drum of coffee, fifty to
eighty pounds in weight, went to mail at another time, and a large
sack of sawdust at another.</p>

<p>Both of the last mentioned <i>went over the weighing scale before
they went to the mail car</i>.</p>

<p>I am speaking only of what casual or chance notice brought to
my attention in three railway stations in Chicago. If similar or
corresponding abuses were indulged at other stations here, as it is a
legitimate inference they were, it is also a legitimate inference that
similar abuses were, and are, practiced throughout the country,
especially in cities of the first, second and third classes&mdash;in cities and
towns on which has been conferred the distinguished honor of having
their mail handled under the watchful eye and supervising care of a
“Presidential Postmaster,” that is, by a postmaster appointed by the
President <i>for partisan reasons and prospective uses</i>.</p>

<p>Again going back to our mutton, I repeat the question, “What is
the extent of this ‘franking’ and ‘penalty’ raid upon the revenues of
the Postoffice Department?” I have cited three local instances
merely to give a “hunch”&mdash;to blaze a line along which thoughtful
people may safely think, and think to some fairly satisfying conclusion.
I do not know the extent of the <i>lootage</i> of postal revenues by
the uses and abuses of those “frank” and “penalty” regulations.
You do not know, and the present Postmaster General <i>admits</i> he
does not know, nor has he any means or method of ascertaining.</p>

<p>On page 11 of the report of the Postoffice Department for the
fiscal year 1909-1910, Mr. Hitchcock very frankly states the fact and
gives his personal opinion of the extent of the franking raid upon the
service of his department. He also suggests a partial remedy which
also I shall quote because it is a good suggestion, on right lines, and for
making it Mr. Hitchcock deserves the thanks of a people over-burdened
by the abuses his suggestion would, I believe, correct in material
degree. At any rate, the suggestion is on right lines. Following
is what he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The unrestricted manner in which the franking privilege is now being used
by the several federal services and by Congress has laid it open to <i>serious abuses</i>&mdash;a
fact clearly established through investigations recently instituted by the department.
While it has been impossible without a better control of franking to
determine the <i>exact expense to the government</i> of this practice, <i>there can be no
doubt that it annually reaches into the millions</i>. It is believed that many abuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of the franking system could be prevented, and consequently a marked economy
effected, by supplying through the agencies of the postal service special official
envelopes and stamps for the free mail of the government, all such envelopes and
stamps to be issued on requisition to the various branches of the federal service
requiring them, and such records to be kept of official stamp supplies as will
enable the Post office Department <i>to maintain a proper postage account</i> covering
the entire volume of free government mail.</p>

</div>

<p>“<i>There can be no doubt that it annually reaches into the millions</i>,”
says Mr. Hitchcock of the cost to his department of transporting and
handling the government free mail matter&mdash;frank and penalty
matter. It should also be noted that he says that “the unrestricted
manner in which the franking privilege is now being used by the
several federal services and by Congress, has laid it open to <i>serious
abuses</i>.”</p>

<p>Not only are the foregoing statements of our Postmaster General
true, but with equal truth he could have said that the abuses of the
postal service practiced by other federal departments have encouraged&mdash;have
coached, so to speak,&mdash;the Postoffice Department
into <i>abusing itself</i>.</p>

<p>Those crates of fruit and cases of canned goods which I saw loaded
into mail cars were probably for some postmaster who conducted a
grocery or fruit stand, as a “side” to his official duties. Or they may
have gone to some “friend” or “good fellow” along the line, or to
some one who stood for a “split” of the express charges on such a
shipment.</p>

<p>The drum of coffee and sack of sawdust may have had consignees
of similar character. But their shipment as mail matter showed
another abuse of the postal service by the Postoffice Department
itself, or by employes of that department. <i>They were weighed into
rail transportation at a time when the average weight of mail carried
during a period of three or six months would govern the rate of pay the
transporting railroad would receive for carrying the mails during a
period of four years.</i></p>

<p>The same might be said of the four carloads of Senatorial
eloquence referred to on a previous page. Those cars were franked
through <i>during the weighing period</i> in the postal service. There is this
difference, however, between those four cars of franked eloquence and
the drum of coffee and sack of sawdust. The former was an abuse of
the postal service and a raid upon its revenues <i>by permission, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by authority, of the postal statutes</i>. The latter was an abuse of the
postal service and raid upon its revenues <i>by employes of the Postoffice
Department itself</i>.</p>

<p>But the point we are after is the extent of federal departmental
raid upon the postal revenues. How much is it? I have confessed
my ignorance of the sum such raid will total. Our Postmaster
General has (see last preceding quotation), confessed his ignorance of
the total. He says there can be “no doubt that it annually reaches
into many millions.”</p>

<p>I have no other evidence or authority at hand save the testimony
of William A. Glasgow, Jr., before the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission in 1906. Mr. Glasgow represented the Periodical
Publishers’ Association. In presenting the case for that association&mdash;strong,
reputable body, representing vast business and public service
(educational, social, fraternal and trade interests)&mdash;Mr. Glasgow used
the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You may take the revenues of the Postoffice Department and give <i>away $19,000,000
per annum in the franking privilege to other departments of government</i> and
then give away $28,000,000 per annum in the beneficent advantages of rural free
delivery, and then lose millions in unequal and exorbitant transportation charges,
certainly $5,000,000, and thus create an apparent and artificial deficit and use
that as a basis for further taxation upon those who read magazines, but no one
will be deceived by such an excuse and no wise Congress will be moved by considerations
so transparent or necessities so unreal.&mdash;<i>Page 544 Penrose-Overstreet
Report (Hearings), 1906-7.</i></p>

</div>

<p>If Mr. Glasgow were speaking in 1911, I have no doubt he would
have raised his figure of $19,000,000 to <i>twenty or more millions</i> as a
nearer approximate of the total of federal departmental raids upon
the earnings or revenues of the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me.</p>

<p>All legitimate departmental service <i>should</i> be rendered by the
Postoffice Department, but that department <i>should receive credit
for such service rendered</i>.</p>

<p>The departmental “abuses” of the postal service are <i>steals</i>.
They should not be tolerated. If extra-departmental service is
rendered (as is well known it is), <i>it should be paid for just the same&mdash;and
at the same service rates&mdash;that Jim Jones, Susie Bowers and
Widow Finerty are compelled to pay for similar service</i>.</p>

<p>Now, we have raidings on the postoffice revenues by the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
departments themselves, including free in county, and by the
Postoffice Department’s looseness of methods in handling its own
business, of somewheres around $22,000,000 a year, not counting the
<i>stuffing</i> of weights during the “weighing period”, which goes to swell
the railway mail pay rates for mail carrying railroads for a period of
four years.</p>

<p>As to the last, I wish to say that Mr. Hitchcock, the present
Postmaster General, has done <i>more</i> to correct such weighing frauds
than has any of his predecessors within the range of my study of the
question. Yet it lingers&mdash;hangs on to an extent which should put
some subordinate postoffice officials and railway officials in restraint&mdash;put
them out of range of opportunity for such looting.</p>

<p>In the face of an annual raid of $22,000,000, what is the use of all
this prattle&mdash;prattle extending over years&mdash;about <i>deficits</i> in the
postal service? Will some one kindly rise in the front pews of the
postal department or in the sanctum of its <i>beneficiaries</i> and tell us?</p>

<p><i>There is no deficit in the postoffice service revenues. The people
pay and have paid for more service than is rendered&mdash;for more service
than they have received or do receive.</i></p>

<p>“But what difference to the people does it make whether they
pay for carrying the departmental mail out of the postal revenues
or have each department pay for its own mail carriage and handling?”
is a common answering interrogative argument (?) to my immediately
preceding charge that the various government departments <i>raid</i>
the postal revenues to the extent of “many millions,” as Mr. Hitchcock
has put it. “The people have to pay for it anyway, do they not?”</p>

<p>Just so, and what difference does it make? Well, here are a few
points of difference which might be seen and comprehended without
jarring any fairly normal intellect off its pedestal:</p>

<p>1. To have the departments pay or give credit to the Postoffice
Department for the service it renders to them is an honest and
approved method in any other business. The present method not
only violates sound business principles but is <i>dishonest</i> as well&mdash;dishonest
because it throws the burden of those “many millions”
for mail haulage and handling of franked and penalty matter <i>upon
the postal rate papers</i>, and not upon all the people of the country
as it should.</p>

<p>2. If the free congressional and departmental matter now costs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
say $20,000,000 a year for mail haulage and handling, then the
government is practicing a policy which both <i>originates and distributes
revenue without appropriation</i>. In other words, the general
government in such practice usurps the function of originating
revenue which function, under the Constitution, is vested in the
Lower House of Congress.</p>

<p>Next, the general government distributes that $20,000,000 (or its
equivalent in service, which amounts to the same thing), to the
several departments, or lets each department raid that service as it
pleases. It does this in flat violation of another section or clause of
the Federal Constitution which provides that the cost of maintenance
and operation, including any contemplated construction and permanent
betterments, shall be provided for in an <i>annual appropriation
bill</i>.</p>

<p>3. The recommended method would greatly lessen the “abuses”
of the postal service by government departments and officials of
which Mr. Hitchcock speaks. On the other hand, the method of the
present and the past <i>invites</i> such abuses. Abuses grow but do not
improve with age. Each year the abuses of which Mr. Hitchcock
speaks in his 1910 report have grown until <i>abuses</i> is scarcely a fitting
designation for them. These abuses of the postal service have grown,
and grown in such a stealthy, porch-climbing way, that they amount
to a <i>colossal steal</i> every year.</p>

<p>4. When they hear so much yodling about “deficits” in the
Postoffice Department, millions of our people are led to believe that
such deficits are created by an excess of cost over receipts in carrying
the letters, postal and postcards, the newspapers, magazines and
other periodicals, the books and merchandise, which the people
themselves entrust to the mails for delivery. They hear that the
postal service “should be self-supporting,” that “each division of the
service should be self-sustaining” and then they are called on for
higher service rates to meet “deficits.”</p>

<p>Why should this great government of ours permit its officials
longer to gold-brick the people with such ping-pong talk? Why not
tell the people the truth, or at least give them an open, honest opportunity
to learn the truth?</p>

<p>The annual federal appropriation bills informs them at least of
the “estimated” expenditures for the year for other departments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Why not give them an <i>honest</i> estimate of what it costs the Postoffice
Department to render a service <i>which should serve them</i>?</p>

<p>Other easily comprehended differences between the present
method of loading all governmental mail service upon the Postoffice
Department without pay or credit for the vast service rendered and a
method which would give that department such credit could readily
be mentioned. However, the four points of difference between the
two methods above cited, and the advantages which would accrue
both to the service and the people by adopting an approved, honest
business method instead of the present unfair, foolish and <i>dishonest</i>
one, are sufficient, I think, to convince the reader that there <i>are</i>
differences between these right and wrong ways of handling the
nation’s postal service&mdash;its governmental mail matter&mdash;that are of
vital importance&mdash;differences which on the one hand invite raidings,
waste and <i>lootage</i> of the postoffice revenues and on the other would
make for economies in the service and for business care and <i>honesty</i>
in the use and expenditures of those revenues.</p>

<h3>EXPRESS COMPANIES CONDUCTING A CRIMINAL TRAFFIC.</h3>

<p>But, says another apologist for the loose, wasteful methods of
the Postoffice Department in handling both its service and its revenues,
“The postal service was originally instituted for handling the government
mail only.”</p>

<p>That be as it may, though I doubt the sweeping assertion of the
statement made, just as I doubt the integrity and truthfulness of
purpose of the person making it. It came to my notice as part of an
argument (?) in defense of the outrageous railway mail pay and mail-car
rental charges which mail carrying railroads have <i>been permitted</i>
to collect from the postal revenues <i>paid by the people</i>. But whether
or not the postal service was originally intended to be merely a dispatch
service for transmission of government orders, documents, etc.,
can stand as no valid reason now for the Federal Government’s
permitting its several departments to use and abuse the vast system
for intercommunication among the people which it has permitted
to be built up, and for the building of which it has taxed (by way of
postal charges) those who made use of the system&mdash;taxed them
<i>excessively</i>, if indeed not somewhat unscrupulously&mdash;whether or not,
not, I say, the government originally intended the mail service to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
an exclusive service for use of the government only has no present
bearing. If such was the original intention, the foolishness of it
must soon have become apparent, for we find that federal laws were
enacted to establish a general postal service <i>for all the people</i>. Not
only were laws enacted for the establishment and regulation of a mail
service, but by the law of 1845 it was clearly intended to make such
service a <i>government</i> monopoly. Section 181 of the federal statutes
reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whoever shall establish any private express for the conveyance of letters
or packets, or in any manner cause or provide for the conveyance of the same by
regular trips or at stated periods over any post route which is or may be established
by law, or from any city, town or place between which the mail is regularly carried,
or whoever shall aid or assist therein, shall be fined not more than $500, or imprisoned
not more than six months, or both.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing makes it quite evident that, as early as 1845 at
least, this government of ours did not intend or design the service on
mail routes then existing, nor on routes to be established, was to
confine itself to the carriage and handling of government matter only.
The establishment of rail post routes and the greater facility and
speed with which such routes would handle the people’s mails&mdash;“the
letters, packages and parcels of people residing along such mail
routes”&mdash;was one of the stock arguments of the Illinois Central
Railroad promoters in 1849-50&mdash;an argument designed to justify
before the people a grant of land to the chartered company so large
as to make the grant a <i>colossal steal</i>. The same or similar argument
was turned loose and persuasively paraded in the oratorical procession
which preceded the vast federal land grants, or land steals, in connection
with the building of transcontinental or Pacific rail lines.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show quite conclusively that whatever
may or may not have been the “intention” of the government at the
first establishment of a mail service&mdash;a service then wholly by water
transportation, by runners and by a “Pony Post” and mail coach&mdash;a
decision was very soon reached to make the postal service a public
one&mdash;a service for all our people&mdash;and to give the government <i>a
monopoly of that service</i>.</p>

<p>No one reading the section of the Revised Statutes of the United
States above quoted will attempt to controvert the statement last
made.</p>

<p>Then, it may be asked again, and justly, too, why does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
government continue to permit its various departments to over-load
and to <i>loot</i> the postal service, the revenues for maintaining which the
people&mdash;the mail-using portion of the people&mdash;alone contribute?</p>

<p>It also may be justly asked, why does the government permit its
postoffice and other officials to <i>scream</i> at the people about “deficits,”
when they have already paid far more than the service&mdash;<i>their</i> service&mdash;costs
the government?</p>

<p>Other equally pertinent questions might be asked, but I shall
forbear. I have shown, I believe, that the raids upon the postoffice
revenues by free-in-county matter and by government itself would
<i>more than meet</i> any “deficit” yodled about in recent years.</p>

<p>That is what I started to demonstrate in this chapter. But there
are other raids and raiders upon the revenues of the Postoffice Department
to which I must advert. I purposed in writing to this phase of
our general subject, to make official prattle about postal service
“deficits” look and sound foolish.</p>

<p>I believe I have already done that, but in justice to the subject
and to the postal ratepayers, at least three other raiders must have
their cloaks slit.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">LATEST OFFICIAL STYLES IN POSTAL CONVERSATION.</span></h2>

<p>The President’s message of February 22, 1912, reached me a few
hours after the closing chapters of this volume had gone to the printers.
With it arrived a copy of the Postmaster General’s report for
the year ending June 30, 1911; also notice from a Congressman
friend that he will have the Hughes Commission’s report on the way
shortly. The Man on the Ladder, like Lucy, when selecting her
spring bonnet, desires the “very latest creation.” It may not be
essentially necessary in a discussion of Federal postal affairs, but even
a hurried reading of the President’s message and the report of Postmaster
General Hitchcock will furnish abundant evidence that
<i>expressed</i> official opinion is somewhat ephemeral and transitory, like
the styles in ladies’ headwear. I have never had the pleasure of
retaining a lady’s unanimous friendship for any appreciable length of
time after giving her my honest opinion of the style of her most
recently acquired bonnet, and readers who have followed me thus far
in my consideration of government postal affairs will have discovered
that my respect for “style” in official oratory and literature needs
coaching.</p>

<p>All that aside, however, the point is that I have persuaded my
printers to “break galley” just here and permit the insertion of a
chapter, having as subject the “very latest” in official postal affairs.</p>

<h3>THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.</h3>

<p>In his Washington Day effort our smiling President is profusely
loyal to the characteristics of his style in composition&mdash;plumage and
displacement. Mr. Taft, however, should set up no claims of originality
of design in Executive messages. Several of his predecessors
presented the people of these United States with numerous displays
of verbal plumage and trimmings. So our President had many
working-models as guides in building the message upon which we shall
proceed to comment.</p>

<p>This message, both in architectural specification and in contour
or <i>ensemble</i>, is largely but a re-trim of the “block” furnished by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Hitchcock in his report, under date of December 1, 1911. In considering
the President’s message and the report of the Postmaster
General, we may, then, shorten our task somewhat by treating the
two public documents as one. They, of course, differ in phrasing and
wording, but the language of the message is only a sort of Executive
“Me-too” approval of what Mr. Hitchcock says in his report, save on
one point&mdash;the taking over of the telegraph companies by the government.
That point we will discuss separately, presenting the argument
of the president against the proposition and the <i>facts</i> presented
by Postmaster General Hitchcock:</p>

<p>“It gives me pleasure to call attention to the fact that the
revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, amounted to $237,879,823.60
and that the expenditures amounted to $237,660,705.48,
making a surplus of $219,118.12. For the year ending June 30, 1909,
the postal service was in arrears to the extent of $17,479,770.47.”</p>

<p>Well, yes, certainly. It gives us all pleasure to see a surplus
grow where only deficits grew before&mdash;gives us great pleasure. Still,
Mr. President, you will permit us humbly to say that it has been a
distressful winter and that here, the very last of February, the
ground is still frozen hard. You, of course, will recall that our
Postmaster General, at intervals during the last fiscal year, as opportunity
for “interviews” offered, gave us confident assurances that his
department was harvesting a surplus, ranging in amount from one to
three million dollars. These assurances beyond our expectations&mdash;our
hopes&mdash;led us to an elevation which makes it a far fall to $219,118.12.
Of course, it is our fault. We should not have permitted our hopes
and expectations to become so altitudinous. But Mr. Hitchcock has
a very persuasive delivery and the public press quoted him so numerously
and so prolixly that we climbed on and on up&mdash;away above the
one and some of us well on towards the three million level and&mdash;well,
as before said, the ground being frozen, a drop to $220,000 jars us
some considerable in alighting. Mr. Hitchcock probably framed up
his mid-year interviews to fit observed conditions, the best he knew
how. Most of us will soon be out of the hospital and in condition to
take an inflation for another flight. Some of the less venturesome
among us may be over-careful not to soar too high, but our tank
capacity remains about the same. So the Postmaster General may
meter nearly the same amount of rhetorical gas to us without fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
The President might, however, if he thinks it would not occasion any
unseemly discord in rendering the grand symphony entitled “Administrative
Policy,” give us folks some information on the following
points&mdash;points raised by a reading of the Washington Day message
and of the 1911 report of the Postmaster General, both of which are
before me, as I write. Of course this is the President’s busy season
and he may not be able to devote as much time to our enlightenment
as he would like to and otherwise would. In that event, he may turn
the subject over to Mr. Hitchcock and request him to separate himself
from a few interviews to clear these matters up for us.</p>

<p>In each annual report of the Postoffice Department I have at
hand (1907 to 1911 inclusive), there appears an item which reads,
“Expenditures on account of previous years.” For the years indicated,
the figures on this item of expenditures are as follows:</p>

<table summary="Expenditures on account of previous years, from the Postoffice Department annual reports">
  <tr>
    <td>1907</td>
    <td class="right">$&nbsp;&nbsp;303,045.55</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1908</td>
    <td class="right">823,664.64</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1909</td>
    <td class="right">586,404.69</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1910</td>
    <td class="right">6,786,394.11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1911</td>
    <td class="right">7,132,112.23</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>As figures are always more or less of a serious nature, we will
here drop the personal element in discussing these points on which
information is desired, and much <i>needed</i>, if public press notices can be
at all depended upon as informative. Of course “figures do not lie.”
Still, it is generally known that, however truthful they may be in
correct calculations, they sometimes appear very peculiar, if not
queer, in tabulations. Some persons have even gone so far as to
assert that “official figures” have frequently been so arranged and
manipulated as to “conceal the facts.” Now, the figures for that
item, “Expenditures on account of previous years” may conceal no
facts which the public has any right to know. Still, there is something
about them which irritates one’s bump of curiosity; that is, if
one’s bump is not abnormally dwarfed or stunted. At any rate, it
appears from press comment that those figures have sand-papered or
otherwise frictioned several bumps of curiosity into a state of irritation.
It is the hope of securing some official light that will act
as a linitive or demulcent to my own and other bumps that persuaded
those figures into evidence here.</p>

<p>What do those figures mean? Are they of any real informative
value or merely convenient things to have around when building the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sub and superstructures of a department annual reports, like the
figures of the postal deficits? A glance at the sums named in the
table shows a variableness that amounts almost to a waywardness in
totaling bills or accounts payable. The federal fiscal year ends June
30th. The annual reports of the Postoffice Department bear date
December 1st&mdash;full four months after the close of the fiscal year.
Surely four months is sufficient time to gather into account the
bills payable or carried-over obligations of a previous year, is it not?
Of course the business of the department is a large business&mdash;over
$237,000,000 last year and about $260,000,000 is asked for this year
in the appropriation bill recently passed by the House. But that is
no reason whatever for failure to account for amounts ranging from
$300,000 to $6,200,000 of unpaid bills of the business year in which the
obligations were created; especially not, when publication of the
accounting is made four months after the close of the year.</p>

<p>This item of “expenditures on account of previous years”
becomes no more understandable, if indeed it does not become
more suggestive of purposeful manipulation, when one looks over the
itemized or segregated expenditures of the year. The items of
expenditure are all of the conventional character used in business
accounting&mdash;operation and maintenance&mdash;such as service salaries,
transportation of the mails, rents, light, fuel, supplies, repairs, etc.
And these are all set down as expenditures of and for the fiscal year’s
business covered by the report, there being not even a suggestion
that any part or portion of the total is an expenditure of the previous
year&mdash;of any previous year.</p>

<p>So much for the detail of expenditures as published in the reports.
From the summaries of receipts and expenditures one gathers no
additional light. In the reports of the Third Assistant Postmaster
General (division of accounts), one finds only the bald item, “Expenditures
on account of previous years,” down to the report of Third
Assistant, James J. Britt, for the year ended June 30, 1910. For
that year Mr. Britt segregates the item as follows:</p>

<p>Anyone taking the trouble to add the five amounts given above,
will discover an error of $217.94 in the total. While that error is only
a trifle, its appearance, however, in the addition of but five items is
not highly commendatory of the ability of Mr. Britt’s expert accountants.
The making of such an error in totaling only five entries has a
tendency to arouse doubt or suspicion as to the reliability or dependability,
not only of the footings given for the longer tabulations published
in the report, but also of the footings which must necessarily
have been made to secure the totals which are entered as items in
such tabulations. Be this as it may, very few persons, aside from
clerks paid for doing the work (and, possibly, an official or two whose
duty it is or should be to see that the work is done accurately), will
go to the trouble to verify even the footings of the published tabulations.
So the errors, if any have been made, are not likely to become
subject matter for much adverse criticism.</p>

<p>My purpose in presenting the showing of the 1910 report on that
item of “expenditure on account of previous years” is to make the
statement that, so far as I have been able to look up the matter, it is
a first weak attempt to make public in the annual report the accounts
and claims carried over from a previous year or years and published
as expenditures of the year to which they are carried. I desire the
reader to note, also, that of the total of “expenditures on account of
previous years” ($6,786,612.05 as above corrected), all but $65,553.53
is set down as expenditures for the year <i>immediately prior</i>&mdash;for 1909.</p>

<p>Now, the business of the Postoffice Department is a cash business&mdash;wholly
so in the matter of receipts and nearly so, or should be, in
the matter of expenditures. This being the case, that item entered in
the published annual reports as “expenditures on account of previous
years” must consist largely of payments made on account of the year
<i>immediately preceding</i> the year covered by the report. As just shown
by the published analysis of the item in the 1910 report, the expenditures
on account of prior years other than the one just preceding are
so small (only $65,553.53 in a total of $6,786,612.05), that they may
be ignored in the attempt I am shortly to make, to show that the item
we have been considering&mdash;“expenditures on account of previous
years”&mdash;has such dominance in the department’s method of accounting,
as evidenced in its annual reports, as to materially affect the
deficit or surplus showing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>First, however, I desire to call attention to another point or two
relating to this item of expenditure.</p>

<p>A glance at the tabulation made of this item shows a huge jump
in its amount for the year 1910 of $6,200,000, round figures. Next, it
appears that the necessities of business, <i>or the emergency needs of
those building the report</i>, forced this item still upward in the showing
for 1911 as made December last&mdash;upward by $345,718.12, making its
total $7,132,112.23. In the report before me, no analysis of that
large carried-over payment on account of prior years is given. The
Third Assistant Postmaster General may furnish information as to the
year or years of its origin. His report has not reached me yet, so I
cannot say. The bald statement is there, however, that 1911 <i>paid
over seven million dollars</i> on account of 1910 and prior bills. It is
also in evidence that <i>no information whatever</i> is published which
enlightens the public as to the amount of <i>unpaid 1911 bills that are
carried forward to 1912 account</i>.</p>

<p>Whether adverse criticism is justifiable or not, such cloaking of
accounts in giving them publicity most certainly warrants it. It is
just this cloaking that has subjected Mr. Hitchcock’s little vest-pocket
surplus for 1911 to much and merited criticism, doubt and
question. Mr. Urban A. Waters, in testifying before the House
Committee on Civil Service Reform <i>harpooned</i> the Postoffice Department
with an accusation that it had permitted a million dollars to
waste, evaporate, be misapplied or stolen, in connection with a deal
for sanitary and safety appliances to railway mail cars.</p>

<p>If Mr. Waters’ charges are grounded in fact, then is provoked and
<i>invited</i> the question: Is it designed or intended to carry that
million into the accounting of 1912&mdash;or into that of some future year&mdash;as
an “Expenditure on account of previous years?”</p>

<p>Mr. Waters is publisher of the Denver Harpoon. He can say
things and is generally recognized as a man who makes a practice of
gathering the facts to back up what he says before he says it. In his
testimony, so far as I know, Mr. Waters made no statement or suggestion
that the evaporated million he spoke of would be, or could be,
very securely <i>cacheted</i> or “fenced” in this “account of previous years.”
It is The Man on the Ladder who points out&mdash;who says&mdash;that such
loose accounting as carries to account of a subsequent year the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
expenditures made or incurred in a previous year can <i>very readily</i>
be made to cloak a steal of one or more millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Then, there are those rural carriers who refused to do as Mr.
DeGraw, Fourth Assistant Postmaster General, told them to do. You
read the papers of course, and&mdash;you believe them, of course, though
most of you say, “Of course, I don’t believe ’em.” Well, it was
broadly published that the <i>Rural Free Delivery News</i> had the temerity
to publish&mdash;not merely to insinuate, mind you&mdash;that Mr. Hitchcock’s
showing of a little $220,000 surplus for the year ended June 30, 1911,
was made possible only <i>by the failure of the Postoffice Department
to make a plain, valid charge of $7,201,149.64 expenditures for that
same fiscal year of 1911</i>!</p>

<p>Those are <i>not</i> the exact words used in giving publicity to the
asserted fact by the <i>Rural Free Delivery News</i>, but that is the meat in
the nut the publication cracked. It appears that the published statement
was closely contiguous to the facts. At any rate, its nestling
juxtaposition to the truth was such that it appears to have neither
looked nor listened well to the department. There is a presidential
campaign on the speedway at this time, with all its usual concomitants
of cackle, clack, cluck and other atmospheric disturbances. Such a
published truth&mdash;if truth it is, and it certainly displays a marked
resemblance in both form and feature to that article so extremely
rare in campaign clutter&mdash;the appearance of such a truth on the
speedway has a tendency to “blanket” some candidate or jockey him
into the fence. With a view no doubt, to guarding against such
possibility, that machine so much used in recent years to smooth down
the rough places in administration roadways was turned onto the
track. A hostile opposition, always somewhat harsh and careless in
its language, calls it “the steam roller.” So the steam roller, with
Fourth Assistant Postmaster General DeGraw at the wheel and manipulating
the levers, rolled out among the rural carriers.</p>

<p>But it appears that it did not roll over them. There are forty-odd
thousand rural carriers and, of course, it would have to be some
“steam roller” to mutilate or seriously dent the ranks of so numerous
a body of men; especially of men who travel about with the fragrance
of the clover blossom and the corn bloom in their nostrils. They
just wouldn’t be rolled and, it is reported they so informed Mr.
DeGraw in very polite and easily understood language. They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
not demand of the publisher of their association organ that he retract
and, to date, the <i>Rural Free Delivery News</i> has, so far as I have seen,
shown no sign of either intention or inclination to back away from
or in any way modify its charge which, in effect, was that the showing
of a surplus&mdash;of even a little “runabout” surplus of $220,000 for the
fiscal year of 1911&mdash;is a “faked” showing&mdash;a showing made possible
only by carrying $7,201,149.64 of 1911 expenditures over to 1912
account.</p>

<p>May the <i>Rural Free Delivery News</i> live long in the land and flourish.</p>

<p>In a letter just received from Mr. W. D. Brown, editor of the
<i>R. F. D. News</i>, he says: “When the Postoffice Committee submitted
its report on March 6, it contained the statement that instead of a
surplus in the postal revenues there was, up to that time, a deficit of
more than $600,000.00 and I am satisfied that the amount will be
greatly increased before the end of the current fiscal year.”</p>

<p>In the <i>News</i> of January 27, the issue to which Mr. DeGraw took
exception, Editor Brown publishes a letter he wrote under date of
January 11, 1912, to Mr. Charles A. Kram, Auditor of the Postoffice
Department. He also publishes Mr. Kram’s reply. In comment on
the reply, Mr. Brown says: “Auditor Kram’s reply throws very
little light upon the subject, except to establish the fact that it is
impossible to say at any time, whether the Postoffice Department is
being conducted at a profit or a loss.”</p>

<p>Next comes Congressman Moon, an admitted authority on postal
affairs and Chairman of the House Committee of Postoffices and Post-Roads.</p>

<p>I see by a press notice that Mr. Moon, in speaking to the question
before his committee recently, stated that there was a “deficit of
$627,845 for the fiscal year of 1911” in the Postoffice Department,
instead of a surplus of $219,118.12, as published in its report, and over
which Mr. Hitchcock and President Taft display so much luxuriant
jubilation.</p>

<p>We have probably presented sufficient testimony to evidence
the fact that the figures presented by our Postoffice Department are
numerously, if not unanimously, doubted among people who take
upon themselves the trouble and the labor of looking into them.
True, the three or four witnesses we have introduced do not agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
as to the amount or magnitude of the shortages or discrepancies they
have found, nor have they said, just where in the loose, bungled accounting
they found the discrepancies. However, my purpose here
is to show only that publicity of such bungled accounting does not
enlighten or inform the public and that the practice of <i>charging the
expenditures of one year to account of the next</i> may easily be made
to cloak and cover up much wasteful if, indeed, not dishonest expenditure.
That being the case, the disagreement of our witnesses as to
the amount of dollars and cents they severally have found to be
mislaid, or not properly accounted for, can make little difference in
the conclusion <i>forced</i> by their testimony on any fair, inquiring mind.</p>

<p>But, it may be argued by apologists for such misleading practice
in accounting or by persons who would plead extenuating conditions
for Mr. Hitchcock and others charged with administering federal
postoffice affairs, that this loose, fraud-inviting practice is of long
standing, that the present administration has not had time to correct
and remedy the faulty practice and that the published showing of
current years is correct, because it is made on the same basis as was
the accounting for many previous years.</p>

<p>All very well said, but it does not answer. Hoary-headed age
in loose, falsifying methods of accounting neither commands respect
nor can stand as reason or excuse for continuing such methods. It
most certainly has no warrant as argument in extenuation for
the continuance of such methods by the present administration.</p>

<p>“Why?” Well, there are several reasons. Mr. Hitchcock, it appears,
has been aware for some two years or more that the practice we
are here discussing was a questionable one, even if he was not fully
informed as to the dangers&mdash;the waste, the fraud, the crookedness&mdash;which
that practice might easily be made to cloak. Yet he has not
only continued the practice, but, it would appear has further indulged
or encouraged its growth. Let us look at the published evidence
on this point.</p>

<p>A <i>reduced</i> deficit in the showing of the Postoffice Department
for the year 1910 was somewhat <i>evidently</i> desired. To that end, the
practice we are criticising charges 1910 with $6,786,394.11 for expenditures
“on account of previous years,” all of which, save $65,553.53,
as previously shown, were expenditures made on account of
the year 1909.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, in a footnote to page 278 of the 1910 report, Third Assistant
Postmaster General Britt presents a somewhat confusing, if not
confused explanation of his showing of the “Revenues and expenditures”
for the year. One statement in the explanation, however, is
resonantly loud in its clearness.</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” says Mr. Britt, “expenditures made in the
first three months of the fiscal year, 1911 on account of the fiscal year
1910 and prior years are not included in the reported deficit for the
year 1910. <i>The amounts are approximately equal.</i>”</p>

<p>I italicize that last statement. Let’s see: 1910 was made to
pay (in accounting only, of course), $6,786,394.11 of 1909 and prior
expenditures and, in an exchange, as simple as swapping Barlows,
$7,132,112.23 of 1910 expenditures are shunted onto the year 1911!</p>

<p>“The amounts are approximately equal,” says Mr. Britt.</p>

<p>Well, the difference is only $345,718.12&mdash;a mere trifle, of course,
in a shuffle of millions. But if that trifle had been added to the 1910
expenditures, where it rightly belonged, the 1910 deficit would have
shown up a trifle <i>over</i> instead of a trifle <i>under</i> six million dollars, as
given in the published report&mdash;a very important matter along in the
closing days of 1910.</p>

<p>Then, too, when our President and his Postmaster General so
warm up to a surplus of $220,000, it is possible, if not probable, that a
trifle like $345,000 might have been a convenience as a deficit <i>reducer</i>
in December, 1910.</p>

<p>On page 19 of Mr. Hitchcock’s report, he presents the following as
one of thirty “Improvements in Organization and Methods” accomplished
by the Postoffice Department during the year ended June 30,
1911:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A change in the financial system whereby the surplus receipts of postoffices
throughout the country are <i>promptly</i> centralized at convenient points for the
purpose <i>of meeting other postal expenditures incurred during the period in which the
surplus receipts accrued</i>, thus paying the expenses of the service from current
receipts and obviating the necessity of applying to the Treasury for a grant to
meet an apparent deficiency in postal revenues <i>when, as has happened in many
instances, no actual deficiency exists</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, that is certainly an “improvement” worthy of all commendation.
If, as stated, it provides for “Meeting other postal expenditures
incurred during the period in which the surplus receipts accrued”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
it certainly should prevent “an apparent deficiency … when …
no actual deficiency exists.”</p>

<p>But why, then, is it reported that over $7,000,000 of expenditures
for the year ended June 30, 1910, are charged to the fiscal year
1911? The report bears date December 1st, 1911&mdash;<i>four months
after the fiscal year 1911 closed</i>. If the receipts of postoffices throughout
the country are “promptly centralized” for the purpose of meeting
current expenditures, it would require super, if indeed not supple,
expertness in accounting to figure out a surplus of $220,000 for a
year’s business which assumes over seven millions in unpaid bills of
a previous year without, apparently, knowing what amount of unpaid
bills can be shunted onto the next year.</p>

<p>But, it may be argued, there is nothing inconsistent in Mr.
Hitchcock’s claim as just quoted, of an improvement in the department’s
system or methods of accounting which makes, or <i>should</i>
make, unnecessary the carrying over to 1911 so large a sum for
expenditures made in or an account of the year 1910. While the
improved methods have been introduced, it may be argued that
insufficient time has elapsed, even to December 1st, to admit of their
application in making up the fiscal report for the year 1911. In short,
that the improved methods were introduced so late in the fiscal year
1910 that the resulting betterments in the system of accounting
could not be shown in the report for 1910-11.</p>

<p>Yes, that possibly might be of some weight in considering this
claimed improvement in the accounting methods of the department.
There is, however, one serious objection to its acceptance as evidence
in this case&mdash;evidence in proof that there was not sufficient time to
make the improved methods operative in the showing for the fiscal
year 1911:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(5) The adoption of improved methods of accounting by which the surplus
or deficiency in the postal revenues is approximately determined <i>within three
weeks from the close of each quarter</i>, instead of three months thereafter, on the completion
of the audit of postmasters’ accounts.</p>

<p>(6) The adoption of an accounting plan that insures <i>the prompt deposit in
the Treasury</i> of postal funds not immediately required for disbursement at postoffices,
<i>thus making available for use by the department</i> several millions of dollars
that, under the old practice, would be tied up in postoffices.</p>

</div>

<p>In his 1909-10 report, Mr. Hitchcock sets forth <i>fifty</i> “improvements”
in methods of handling and conducting the business of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Postoffice Department&mdash;improvements made <i>prior</i> to June 30, 1910,
mind you. Well, the foregoing quotation presents numbers 5 and 6
of the enumerated 50 “improvements” that were set up as having
already been instituted&mdash;instituted prior to June 30, 1910. Beyond
saying that the department has certainly had ample <i>time</i> to install
and make operative the improvements in methods of handling its
business and of accounting, which its published reports claim to have
been made, comment is unnecessary. If the improvements, as
<i>twice</i> claimed in the two annual reports from which I have quoted have
been made, then, it is pertinent to ask: Why was <i>over seven millions</i>
of 1909-10 expenditures carried to 1910-11 account?</p>

<p>Such a showing excuses another question&mdash;excuses it because it
<i>invites</i> the question:</p>

<p>What amount&mdash;how <i>many millions of dollars</i>&mdash;of 1910-11 unpaid
bills and claims was carried over to become a charge against the fiscal
year 1911-12?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I am fully aware that this may be all readily explained
by saying that the claimed improvements as set forth have nothing
whatever to do with the practice of carrying forward unpaid bills of
one fiscal year and making them a charge against the receipts of the
next or some subsequent fiscal year.</p>

<p>Such an explanation is easily understood, <i>because it does not
explain</i>. That is, it is an explanation which, to be <i>believably</i> understood,
requires more explaining than do the faults and crooks in the
method of accounting it attempts to explain.</p>

<p>That the “fumbling” of this carrying-over practice <i>needs</i> correction&mdash;needs
<i>abolishment</i>&mdash;will be seen from a glance at the two
following tabulations. That the practice also makes the departments’
annual showing of the <i>results</i> of the business of the year&mdash;any year&mdash;almost
valueless is also made evident&mdash;that is, valueless so far as real,
dependable information is concerned as to whether the postal service
is conducted at a loss or at a profit.</p>

<p>The first tabulation following shows the published figures for the
fiscal year’s expenses as given in the departmental reports. It also
shows what the expenses of the fiscal years indicated really were,
when their unpaid bills (as shown by the next annual report of the
department) are charged against them.</p>

<p>The whole charge, “On Account of Previous Years” in each report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
is treated as a charge against the <i>immediately preceding year</i>. It has
been shown that payments on “account of previous years,” as given
in the published reports, include for years other than the first or
immediately preceding, amounts so small that they may be, for
purposes of comparison, ignored.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, the figures in the following tabulations of expenditures
and deficits&mdash;accepting the department’s published statements
of receipts as correct&mdash;are far more enlightening to the general
public as to the results of each year’s business, for the five years here
covered, than are the statements made in the annual reports of the
department for the years named.</p>

<p>The second table shows the “deficits,” or balances for each of the
five years as compared with the deficits shown in the annual reports
of the department, the corrected figures being subject, of course, to any
trifling reduction which may have resulted from the payment of bills
carried into the account from some other than the immediately preceding
year:</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that the corrected figures
show a range of variance from the published figures, of over $6,400,000.
That is, the corrected figures are some $230,000 below for the year
1908 and more than $6,200,000 above for the year 1910, the showing
in the departments published reports.</p>

<p>A similar correction for the year 1911 cannot be made until the
department chooses to enlighten the public as to the amount of 1910-11
unpaid bills it <i>has carried forward to become a charge against the
receipts of the year 1911-12</i>.</p>

<p>As the account for the year stands above, the surplus for the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
1910-11 is $7,363,009.15&mdash;not the comparatively trifling amount of
$219,118.12, as published. Of course, if the report shows that 1912
pays $7,363,009.15 of 1911 expenditures, then the paltry surplus for
the last-named year may stand as given in the report. But if the 1912
report should show that so much as <i>one dollar</i> more of 1911’s unpaid
bills were shunted onto 1912 than 1911 paid on account of 1910’s
shunted bills ($7,132,112.23), then Mr. Hitchcock’s joy-producing
“surplus” will vanish as an <i>actuality</i> in correct accounting.</p>

<p>There, again, is shown a range of more than $6,400,000 between
the published and the <i>very near</i> actual deficits of the several years,
not including 1911, for the showing on which, for reasons stated, I
and the rest of the “dear people,” who are just now being “worked”
for votes, will have to wait until the 1912 report is published.</p>

<p>Why, nothing but a government treasury&mdash;the treasury of our
easily “bubbled” people&mdash;could survive that sort of bookkeeping for
the time covered in the above tabulated statement of published and
<i>actual</i> yearly shortages and of <i>one</i> alleged surplus.</p>

<h3>AN EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT&mdash;POSSIBLY.</h3>

<p>We will now detach ourselves from these wearisome figures and
more wearisome figuring, using figures only as a sort of garnishment
to chief courses served to us by the President and our Postmaster
General.</p>

<p>The receipts of the Postoffice Department, as published in its
annual reports, were $34,317,440.53 greater for the fiscal year 1910-11
than for the year 1908-9.</p>

<p>Both the President and Mr. Hitchcock are eloquently ebullient
because of the appearance of a tender shoot or bud of a surplus in a
place where nothing but deficits grew before. But neither of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
appears to have boiled over in either message or report to show the
people what splendid things have been accomplished in two years
with that thirty-four millions of increased revenues. I wonder why?
Possibly the failure of ebullition at the point indicated is the result
of oversight. Of course, it may have resulted from lack of thermic
encouragement or inducement. Or, it may be, that some “induced
draft” drew the major part of the thirty-four millions up the smoke-stack
without leaving a B. T. U. equivalent under the kettle.</p>

<p>“The Postmaster General recommends, <i>as I have done in previous
messages</i>, the adoption of a parcels post, and the beginning of this in
the organization of such service on rural routes and <i>in the city delivery
service first</i>,” says President Taft.</p>

<p>If the President really has recommended in “previous messages”
the “beginning” of a parcels post “experiment” in “the City Delivery
Service” such recommendation entirely escaped my notice. A “test”
of a parcels post service on rural routes&mdash;yes. That was much talked
of a year or more since. But of an “experimental test” of an improved
parcels post in urban carrier service, little or nothing was said
or, if said, it did not make sufficient noise for The Man on the Ladder
to hear. However, I presume it is as permissible for the conceptions
and concepts of a President to broaden, enlarge and improve as it is
for those of a Postmaster General to broaden, enlarge and improve.
For that matter, a proportional, if not entirely corresponding
thought-expansion may be occasionally noticed in the Department
of the Interior as conducted and operated by common, ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>As the parcels post is the subject of a later chapter which
is already in type, further consideration here is unnecessary. It may
be said, however, that extending the proposed test&mdash;any “test”&mdash;of a
parcels post service to city free delivery routes, instead of confining it
to a few “selected” rural routes as Mr. Hitchcock proposed it should
be confined in his 1910 report, is a step in the right direction&mdash;a step
in advance. Still, such a step is but dilatory; is but procrastinating.
A cheap, efficient, <i>general</i> parcels post service must come and, now
that the people are aroused&mdash;aroused as to the <i>criminal</i> wrongs
inflicted upon them by a Postoffice Department and a Congress that
have acted for thirty or more years as if indifferent to or not cognizant
of those wrongs&mdash;it must <i>come quickly</i>, unless, of course, it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
develop that the people are, really and truly, as big fools as railroad,
express companies and certain public officials have treated them as
being.</p>

<p>“The commission reports that the evidence submitted for its
consideration is sufficient to warrant a finding of the <i>approximate</i>
cost of handling and transporting the several classes of second-class
mail known as paid-at-the-pound-rate, free-in-county, and transient
matter, in so far as relates to the services of transportation, postoffice
cars, railway distribution, rural delivery, and certain other items of
cost, <i>but that it is without adequate data to determine the cost of the
general postoffice service and also what portion of the cost of
certain other aggregate services is properly assignable to second-class
mail matter</i>.… It finds that in the fiscal year 1908
… the cost of handling and transporting second-class
mail matter … was about 6 cents a pound for
paid-at-the-pound-rate matter, and for free-in-county, and transient
matter, each approximately 5 cents a pound, and that upon this
basis, as modified by <i>subsequent deductions in the cost of railroad
transportation</i>, the cost of paid-at-the-pound rate matter, for the
services mentioned” (I have not mentioned all the “services” enumerated
by the President, all being covered in the words “handling and
transportation”), “is approximately 5½ cents a pound.” …</p>

<p>That is from the President’s Washington Day message. Can you
beat it? Well, it will take a smooth road and some going to do it.</p>

<p>First, it is cheerfully admitted that the Commission (the Hughes
Commission) had no “adequate data to determine the cost of the
general postoffice service and also what portion of the cost of <i>certain
other aggregate services</i> is properly assignable to second-class mail
matter,” and then our President proceeds&mdash;with equal cheerfulness
and smiling confidence (<i>or is it indifference?</i>) to assure us that the
Commission proceeded to figure 6 cents a pound as the cost of handling
and carriage of <i>paid</i> pound-rate second-class matter and 5 cents a
pound as the cost of corresponding service for <i>free-in county</i> and so-called
“transient” matter!</p>

<p>Again I ask, can you beat it? If you can, please send me your
picture&mdash;full size and two views, front and profile. I would derive
much pleasure from a look at your front and side elevations. Of
course, the President has an official right to a “style” of his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
A “style” of expression, however, cannot be protected by copyright,
otherwise, as stated at the opening of this interpolated chapter,
President Taft would be guilty of infringement. Other presidents
have run into verbose verbosity in expressing themselves. It is an
official <i>convenience</i> at times to do so, however ludicrously <i>open of
intent</i> or “phunny” it may appear to laymen.</p>

<p>The President, in the paragraph of his message above quoted,
recalls two of his “arguments” before the Swedish American Republican
League, of Chicago, which arguments I had the honor to
hear. In one instance he was flourishing about our ideal of popular
government and said: “What we are all struggling for, what we
all recognize as the highest ideal in society, is <i>equality of opportunity</i>.…
Of course perfect equality of opportunity is
<i>impossible</i>,” then <i>why</i> it is impossible followed for a paragraph.</p>

<p>It was so nicely and redundantly redundant, so resilient in phrasing,
so honestly <i>earnest</i>, that one just <i>had</i> to go along with our President,
whether or not one could see how “the highest ideal in society”
could possibly be found in a chase after the “impossible.”</p>

<p>At another point in his kindly persuasive Come-unto-me discourse,
he pointed out to us how liable a “majority of the people”
is to “make mistakes by hasty action and lack of deliberation.”
Then, after a paragraph of beautiful foliage, the President cited the
anti-trust law of 1890 as an evidence of the advantages and beneficent
results of ample “deliberation” before taking action in matters of
“grave import”. He explained that the decision of the Supreme Court
was at first “misunderstood, or if not misunderstood, was improperly
expressed, so as to <i>discourage</i> those who were interested in the federal
power to restrain and break up these industrial monopolies. <i>After
twenty years’ litigation</i> the meaning of the act has been made clear by
a decision of the Supreme Court, prosecutions have been brought and
many of the most <i>dangerous</i> trusts have been <i>subjected to dissolution</i>.”</p>

<p>It was all so fine, so lulling if not luring! It made one feel as if
he were lost or had gone to sleep looking for himself. But when in a
comfortable seat, in the owl car, where the jostle of the wicked world
was so toned down and gentled as to permit a little analytic thought,
that beautiful illustration of the value of making haste slowly and of
long, careful “deliberation” when acting on matters of vast import
recurred to us&mdash;that Anti-trust Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“After twenty years” careful deliberation, the Supreme Court
was able to decide what the act meant! Was able, also, to decide
what its <i>own prior decisions meant</i> and prosecutions were then
brought and “many of the most dangerous trusts have been subjected
to dissolution!”</p>

<p>All of it listened very well, but it don’t stand the wash very well.
It is matter of common knowledge that during the twenty years the
Supreme Court was industriously trying to find out what the Anti-Trust
Act and its own decisions meant, the trust organizers and
promoters got away with <i>more than eight billions of unearned values</i>&mdash;some
set the figure above fifteen billions. The Supreme Court made
haste slowly in its “deliberation,” while the respectable get-rich-quick
Wallingfords were going after the people’s money and going
in high-powered cars with the speed levers pulled clear down. No
making haste slowly or duly <i>prolonged</i> deliberation with Wallingfords’.</p>

<p>Then, if one will take the trouble to glance at market quotations
of the stocks of <i>any</i> of “those dangerous trusts” which “have been
subjected to dissolution,” he will find that they have passed through
the trying ordeal of “dissolution” without the turn of a feather. All
are smiling. Why should they not? Stock quotations show that
Standard Oil is over $250,000,000 better off than before its <i>deliberated</i>
judicial dissolution. The Tobacco Wallingfords are also many
millions ahead of the game since “dissolution” set in. And “Sugar”&mdash;well
since the Sugar Trust was “busted” and subjected to the
“dissolution” process nearly all its controlled saccharine matter
appears to be trickling into its bank account. Similar “most dangerous
trusts” show similar evidences of “dissolution” since the Supreme
Court processed them.</p>

<p>What has this to do with our immediate subject? Nothing
whatever. It is a mere interpolation&mdash;with a purpose. Its purpose
is to evidence what appears to be a practiced habit with our President&mdash;a
florescence or foliation similar to that displayed in the quotation
I have made from his Washington Day Message. In the quoted
paragraph, the reader will observe that he first says the Hughes
Commission was “without data to determine the cost” of certain very
important factors in the aggregate expense of handling and transporting
the mails, and then he immediately proceeds to inform us that the
Commission finds that the “cost of handling and carriage of paid-at-the-pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
rate matter was about 6 cents a pound,” etc.&mdash;a virtual
impeachment of the Commission’s finding before the finding is stated.</p>

<h3>THE HUGHES COMMISSION.</h3>

<p>What little space permits me to say of the report of the Hughes
Commission may as well be said here.</p>

<p>In their report the commissioners very frankly admit the meagerness,
or, on numerous important points, total lack of informative
data. But, as the President states, they proceed to put on record a
finding of 6 cents a pound as the cost of handling and transporting
paid second-class matter and 5 cents a pound as the cost of similar
service on free-in-county matter, for the year 1908. They finally
recommend, however, that the present “transient” rate (for copies
of periodicals mailed by other than publishers) be continued&mdash;1
cent for each 4 ounces; also that the present free-in-county privilege
be retained, <i>but not extended</i>.</p>

<p>What does that “not extended” mean?</p>

<p>I do not know. Do you? Does it mean that the country newspapers
now issued&mdash;<i>now</i> entered in Postoffice Department for free
haulage and handling&mdash;shall continue free and that no new newspapers
established, founded and distributed in counties, shall be
transported and handled <i>free</i>?</p>

<p>If it does not mean that, what does it mean? If it means that,
then why does this Commission recommend a thing that is primarily&mdash;<i>elementary</i>&mdash;wrong
under the organic law of this government?</p>

<p>The Constitution of these United States <i>specifically</i> prohibits
“special” legislation. Then why, I ask, should the recommendation
of this Commission be complied with? I have been publishing <i>The
Hustler</i>, a <i>controlled</i> Republican or Democrat 4 to 8 pager, as the case
may be, for four years. Paul Jones comes along and flings in his
money to publish and print the <i>Democratic Booster</i> in the same
county. Does this Commission mean to recommend that <i>The
Hustler</i> be carried and distributed free in the county and that <i>The
Booster</i> be required to pay the regular pound rate for the same
service?</p>

<p>A flat rate of 2 cents per pound is recommended for all other
periodical matter, newspapers and magazines alike.</p>

<p>Well, that recommended rate is of course, better than Mr. Hitchcock’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
“rider” recommendation, discussed in a previous page. The
Commission’s “finding” that the cost of carriage, handling and
delivery of second-class mail “was approximately 6 cents a pound” is
also an appreciable step-down (toward the facts), as compared with
Mr. Hitchcock’s <i>assured</i>&mdash;milled, screened and sifted&mdash;finding that
said cost was 9.23 cents a pound&mdash;a finding as late as March 1, 1911.
So if this commendable “merger” of views, opinions and <i>guesses</i> keeps
growing, as industrial, rail and other mergers are wont to grow, the
postal <i>rate payers</i> of the country may hope yet to find that even their
great men may agree.</p>

<p>I have discussed this second-class mail rate&mdash;the cent-a-pound
rate for periodicals&mdash;elsewhere. With private companies (the express
companies) carrying and delivering second-class mail matter for
the average mail haul, at <i>one-half cent a pound</i> (and standing for a
“split” with the railroads for one-half of that), the question as to
whether or not the government <i>can</i> carry mail matter without loss
at <i>one cent a pound</i>, is not worth debating among men whose brains
are not worn in their sub-cellars.</p>

<p>I mean the last statement to apply to third and fourth class
matter as well as to second. What it has cost the government, or
what it now costs the government, to transport, handle and distribute
the mails is another and quite different matter from what such service
can be and <i>should</i> be rendered for. Was it not that the people’s
money is lavishly wasted by such foolishness and foolery, a dignified
commission of three or six men sagely deliberating upon, critically
“investigating” and laboredly discussing what it costs the government&mdash;what
the government in 1908 or any other year paid&mdash;to carry and
distribute the mails, might be staged as the working model of a joke.
If a Commission’s time and the people’s money were spent in making
a careful, thorough investigation as to what it <i>should</i> cost to collect,
transport, handle and distribute the mails, and as to just where and
how the millions of dollars, now annually wasted in an over-unmanned,
incompetently managed, raided and raiding service, could be saved,
results fully warranting the expenditures made on account of these
postal-investigating commissions would readily be obtained.</p>

<p>A summary of the proceedings of the Hughes Commission is
presented elsewhere. Here I shall take space for only two or three
observations. First, as is evidenced by the Commission’s report, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Postoffice Department was before it in conspicuous volubility and the
frequency of a stock ticker during a raid, with call money at 84.
Postmaster General Hitchcock and his Second and Third Assistants
appear to have been the chief “floor representatives” of the department
during the flurry. Of 201 “Exhibits” listed by the Commission,
about 100 of them&mdash;reports, documents, memoranda and letters&mdash;found
origin if not paternity in the Postoffice Department, and a
considerable portion of them was already on file in government
archives. Of the sixteen papers submitted after close of “Hearings,”
fourteen or fifteen are letters and memoranda of the department,
besides which seven memoranda are mentioned as having been
received from “the Postoffice Department and not marked as
exhibits.”</p>

<p>That should make up a pretty fair collection of departmental
argument, views, opinions and “estimates,” should it not? It is
very doubtful, though&mdash;debatable, if not doubtful&mdash;if the collection
is worth $50,000. Especially does such a valuation appear questionably
excessive, when it is observed that much of the collection is made
up of public documents, the findings of former postal commissions and
committees, and of reports and showings made up by the Postoffice
Department at departmental expenditure of time and money, and
not at an expense chargeable to the Commission’s appropriation. Of
course the Hughes Commission may not have followed the precedent
set by most prior postal Commissions, and by commissions in general.
The Hughes Commissioners may not have spent all of their $50,000
appropriation. Let us hope they did not. However, a statement of
expenditures actually made would be, by some of us at least, an
appreciated “exhibit.”</p>

<p>Another feature of the Commission’s 108-page report that deserves
special attention is the close adherence of its findings to <i>the findings
of present postal officials</i>. Even in cases where the opinions of past
officials are quoted commendingly, the opinions usually support and
bolster the opinions of Mr. Hitchcock and his assistants. The report
presents a number of tabulations, among which are several that are
most excellent and informative. However, the tabulations, and the
more important conclusions of the text as well, are based upon
“estimates,” rather than upon ascertained facts. Then, too, these
estimates, as is somewhat annoyingly evident, are all, or nearly all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the departmental estimates of the present Administration. Of course,
that should in no way impair their value or dependability and it
probably would not, but for two facts: The present Postmaster
General has, for two years or more, displayed great activity&mdash;at
times, a fevered if not frenzied activity&mdash;to secure the enactment
of laws and issuance of executive orders to accomplish results
which, while they may appear most desirable to him, were considered
by many <i>thousands</i> of our people as being very objectionable, indeed,
inimical to the fundamental right of free speech in this country and a
menace to a free press and to popular education. The “estimates”
which the Hughes Commission has published as basis for its findings
quite uniformly, if not entirely, support the contentions which
the Postmaster General has been making&mdash;at times, making with
little or no warrant of fact to support.</p>

<p>Again, it will be observed by careful readers of the Commission’s
report that the “estimates” upon which several of its more important
findings are based, are conspicuously lacking in elements essentially
necessary in the structure of reliable estimates from which fact or
facts may be deduced. To warrant the drawing of conclusions of
fact from it, the structural material of an estimate must consist
largely, if not wholly, of fact, not of conclusions drawn from other
conclusions which, in turn were deduced from estimates based on
other estimates that may or may not have been accurate and dependable.</p>

<p>As just stated, the estimates which the Commission appears
largely to have accepted, are nearly all productions of the Postoffice
Department. Few of them are built directly upon ascertained facts.
Most of them are estimates of estimates based on other estimates.
It appears that the Postmaster General’s estimates are Assistant
Postmaster Generals’ estimates of the estimates made by weighing
clerks of the several classes of mail-weights carried by certain railroads
during six months in the year 1908. The nearest approach
such a method or procedure makes to a fact is an estimate of the fact,
you see.</p>

<h3>A POSTAL TELEGRAPH.</h3>

<p>One more quotation from the President’s message and this
chapter may end. This quotation is anent the proposition of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the telegraph service of the country operated by the government&mdash;in
connection with the postal service. Mr. Hitchcock’s recommendation
in the matter of a postal telegraph “is the only one,” says the
President, “in which I cannot concur.” I shall first quote President
Taft and then quote Mr. Hitchcock as he expressed himself in his
1911 report:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This presents a question of government ownership of public utilities which
are now being conducted by private enterprise under franchises from the government
I believe that the true principle is that private enterprise should be permitted
to carry on such public utilities under <i>due regulation as to rates by proper
authority</i> rather than that the government should itself conduct them. This
principle I favor because I do not think it in accordance with the best public
policy thus greatly to increase the body of public servants. <i>Of course, if it could
be shown that telegraph service could be furnished to the public at a less price than it is
now furnished to the public by telegraph companies</i>, and with equal efficiency, the
argument might be a strong one in favor of the adoption of the proposition. But
I am not satisfied from any evidence that if these properties were taken over by the
government they could be managed any more economically or any more efficiently
or that this would enable the government to furnish service at any smaller rate
than the public are now required to pay by private companies.</p>

<p>More than this, it seems to me that the consideration of the question ought to
be <i>postponed until after the postal savings banks have come into complete and smooth
operation and after a parcels post has been established not only upon the rural routes
and the city deliveries, but also throughout the department. It will take some time
to perfect these additions to the activities of the Postoffice Department</i> and we may well
await their complete and successful adoption before we take on a new burden in
this very extended department.</p>

</div>

<p>As an exhibition of rhetorical aviation, that is both going and
soaring some. How beautifully it “banks” on the curves! How
smooth its motor runs! And its transmission! Words fail me.</p>

<p>Some paragraphing wit has said, “Foolishness is as plentiful as
wisdom isn’t.” Our President appears to know that we fools can
take in a lot of foolishness without our tanks sloshing over as we stumble
along the old, well-worn way&mdash;the way that leadeth the earned
dollar into somebody’s unearned bank account. But I do not intend
to comment. The italics I have taken the liberty to mix into the
President’s verbal flight is all the comment needed. Mr. Taft makes
it quite clear that all we fools need to do is wait&mdash;make haste slowly,
take time for due deliberation. Of course, some of us fools think we
know, or presume to think we know, that the telegraph companies are
charging us two or three prices for the service they render&mdash;frequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
do not render for twenty-four or more hours after it ceases to be
a service. But think of the good other folks derive from the pocket
change they extract from us! The Western Union is, or was, a
“Gould property.” It paid interest or dividends on eighty or more
millions of <i>quasi</i> and <i>aqua pura</i> in stocks and bonds. But think of
the fun sons George and Howard had! Think of the former maintaining
the beautiful Lakewood place, leasing English hunting
preserves, playing polo and “busting” into, through and around
Knickerbocker society circles! How could Howard have built a
replica of Kilkenny Castle on Long Island Sound, where he and
“Wild West Katie,” it is said, spent millions and had a realistic
Kilkenny-Cat time of it? Or how could Frank, the fourth and last
son of Jay Gould, have given to the world such a lurid, if not illuminating,
picture of the “Married Rue” as was exhibited at his divorce
hearings? And there is “Sister Anna”&mdash;Well, it is sufficient to say
that Anna Gould could not have blown away ten millions in settling
“Powder-Puff” Boni’s debts and turning him loose in the straight
and broad way which leadeth unto the life that is somewhat too “fast”
for even unearned money.</p>

<p>Well, none of the before-mentioned “life lessons” could have
been set for the world’s enlightenment&mdash;likewise, disgust&mdash;had the
people of this country not waited, not made haste slowly, in “due
deliberation,” while the Western Union and other “Gould properties,”
were used to separate them from many millions of dollars which no
Gould or Gould property ever earned.</p>

<p>But this is digressing. The President advises us to wait, to
delay action a little longer&mdash;until the “postal savings banks have
come into complete and smooth operation,” until “after a parcels
post has been established … throughout the department.”
Just wait and keep on paying twenty-five cents for a ten-word
wire to your mother or friend ten miles out, even though the
veriest fool knows that a postal telegraph service would carry a
twenty-five word message to any postoffice in the United States for
ten cents. Just keep on waiting&mdash;<i>until the big telegraph interests
have sheared a few millions more fleece</i>.</p>

<p>But, says President Taft, “If it could be shown that telegraph
service could be furnished to the public at a less price,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Well, maybe there is a sort of visual aphasia which makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
quarter look like ten cents to some men. If not, I am at a loss to
understand how it yet remains for anyone to be “shown” that telegraph
service could be furnished to “the public at a less price than it
is now furnished by the telegraph companies.” Postmaster General
Hitchcock furnished sufficient information, it seems to me, to show
the President, or anyone else for that matter, that telegraph service
“could be furnished the public” at rates much below those the telegraph
companies collect. Mr. Hitchcock speaks in part, as follows&mdash;page
14, 1911 report:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The telegraph lines in the United States should be made a part of the postal
system and operated in conjunction with the mail service. Such a consolidation
would unquestionably result in important economies and permit the adoption of
lower telegraph rates. Postoffices are maintained in numerous places not reached
by the telegraph systems and the proposed consolidation would therefore afford
a favorable opportunity for the wide extension of telegraph facilities. In many
small towns where the telegraph companies have offices, the telegraph and mail
business could be readily handled by the same employees. The separate maintenance
of the two services under present conditions results in a needless expense.
In practically all the European countries, including Great Britain, Germany,
France, Russia, Austria, and Italy, the telegraph is being operated under government
control as a part of the postal system. As a matter of fact, the first telegraph
in the United States was also operated for several years, from 1844 to 1847,
by the government under authority from Congress, and there seems to be good
ground why the government control should be resumed.</p>

</div>

<p>While much more could be said in support of Mr. Hitchcock’s
position, he has said sufficient in the above, I think, to “show” even
a President.</p>

<p>As evidence that the “estimates,” upon which the Hughes Commission
so largely base their findings are not entirely dependable,
I desire to make two brief quotations from other pages of Mr. Hitchcock’s
1911 report. On page 17, as the first of thirty “Improvements
in Organization and Methods,” the Postmasters General sets forth as
having been accomplished in the service during the fiscal year 1911,
will be found this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The successful completion of an inquiry into the cost to railway companies
of carrying the mails and the submission of a report to Congress making recommendations
for revising the manner of fixing rates of pay for railway mail transportation.</p>

</div>

<p>On pages 9 and 10 of the report, in discussing a readjustment of
railway mail pay, Mr. Hitchcock uses the following language:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>The statistics obtained during the course of the investigation, disclosed for
the first time <i>the cost of carrying the mails</i> in comparison with the revenues derived
by the railways from this service.… The new plan (paying
railways on the basis of car space occupied by the mails), if authorized by Congress,
will require the railway companies each year to report what it costs them to
carry the mails and such other information as <i>will enable the department to determine
the cost of mail transportation</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>From the above it would seem that Congress was to be asked to
adopt at its present session a “new plan” which “will enable the
department to determine the cost of mail transportation;” to determine
an important service fact which, according to the preceding
quotation and also to the first sentence of the one just made, was
determined sometime <i>prior to June 30, 1911</i>.</p>

<p>Has the Postoffice Department already determined the facts as
the report twice claims, or has it merely collected some data upon
which to base an “estimate?” Which enables it to make a more
or less reasonable <i>guess</i> at the cost of mail transportation?</p>

<span class="smaller">RAILWAY AND EXPRESS RAIDERS.</span></h2>

<p>I intended to take up here the railway mail-pay and postal car
rental steal and then the infringement by express companies on the
postal service and its revenues. However, since I have quoted Section
181 of the federal statutes governing, I think it as well, or better,
here to take notice of the express companies’ raiding into the postal
revenues&mdash;raidings into the field of service which the <i>law specifically
reserved for the operation of the nation’s Postoffice Department</i>.</p>

<p>Let me ask the reader to turn back a few pages and read again
that Section 181 of the federal statutes. Let me ask him also to
think a moment about the character of small parcels and packages
the express companies carry. To help our memories a little, let us
note a few items.</p>

<p>The express companies carry and deliver for the general public
money remittance for any sum. For carrying sealed remittance of a
hundred dollars or less&mdash;for the carriage and delivery of which the
government has provided in its postal money order regulations&mdash;the
express companies are <i>criminals</i> under that Section 181.</p>

<p>Had the express company “influence” not reached federal legislators,
it is not only highly probable, but almost a certainty, that our
postal service would today be both prepared and permitted to transmit
and deliver sums of money to any amount and at rates <i>lower</i> than
now charged by the express companies.</p>

<p>If a publisher has ten or a hundred thousand copies of a book to
deliver to mail-order purchasers, some express company steps in and
makes him an offer for delivery, a <i>trifle lower</i> than the 8-cent-a-pound
rate charged by the Postoffice Department for the same service.</p>

<p>In such instance, the express company making such tender of
delivery on any “post route” is a <i>criminal</i>, under the <i>specific</i> wording
of that Section 181.</p>

<p>In previous pages of this volume the reader will find testimony
of people and of firms that pay large carriage bills for second-class
matter. Among this testimony are found statements (some of them
under jurat), that the express companies carry periodicals in bulk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
five to ten pounds and upward from New York to Chicago, and to
other points equally distant from office of publication, at a rate
materially below the cent-a-pound rate charged by the government
for postal carriage.</p>

<p>In one instance, it is known that one express company has offered
to contract to carry periodicals from New York to Chicago over a
certain connecting railroad at a rate of <i>one-half cent a pound</i>.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>It means simply this:&mdash;The railroad handling such express business
hauls express cars <i>en train</i> with the United States mail, and the
railroad handling such express consignments of periodical mail matter
makes the New York-Chicago haul at somewhere around <i>one-fourth
of a cent a pound</i>. That is, it is somewhere around one-fourth cent a
pound unless the carrying road takes <i>more</i> than half the express
company’s contract charge.</p>

<p>“What more?”</p>

<p>The express company contracting such business and the railroad
handling it are <i>criminals</i> under that Section 181 of the federal statutes.</p>

<p>In this connection I wish to say that under a strict&mdash;yes, under
a just&mdash;construction of that Section 181, I am not sure but that the
publishers party to such contracts are not also parties to the crime.</p>

<p>From the <i>letter</i> of that section, I confess an inability to see any
other construction of it than that previously stated. The United
States government, or at least its legislative department, in 1845,
<i>intended</i> that all such matter&mdash;letters (sealed matter), “packets,”
or packages and parcels, should be turned over to the Postoffice
Department for transportation, handling and delivery.</p>

<p>Why has not the intent of that law been carried out?</p>

<p>Why are the express companies permitted, and for years been
permitted, so brazenly to perpetrate criminal violations of that postal
statute? Why and how does it chance that they (the express companies),
can violate the law for years and go unscathed&mdash;go
unchastized for plain, open, brazen violation of that Section 181
of the federal statutes? Yes, <i>why</i>?</p>

<p>There is but one answer; there <i>can</i> be but one answer.</p>

<p>Federal executives, federal legislators and federal judicial
officials <i>have connived with private individuals and interests to nullify
or make abortive that Section 181</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you ever read any of Allan A. Benson’s writings? “No?”
Then you have missed something you should never miss again, should
opportunity perambulate around your way. Allan A. Benson says
something when he writes&mdash;says it blunt, plain and <i>hard</i>&mdash;says it in
language that guarantees its own truth&mdash;says it in an open, broad
way in which no man, “even though a fool” or a joy-rider, can go
astray. In both the February and the March, 1911, numbers of
Pearson’s Magazine, Mr. Benson writes on the parcels post as a subject.
I shall probably quote from him extendedly when I reach that
division of our general subject in this volume. Mr. Benson <i>knows</i>
his subject. And what is didactically of more importance, <i>he makes
the reader know he knows it</i>.</p>

<p>Well, even with a fear that I may here reprint from him some
paragraphs for which I may have a greater need later, I cannot refrain
from quoting him in answer to those several “whys” I have just
written, anent the violations of that Section 181 of the postal statutes.</p>

<p>Following his quotation of that section of the federal statutes,
Mr. Benson says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The purpose of this law was to give the United States government a monopoly
of the mail-carrying privilege. The law was first enacted in 1845, and,
although the statutes have been revised from time to time, it stands today in
precisely the form herein given.</p>

<p>On the face of the law the express companies are law-breakers. But it is
not enough to look at the face of a law. Everybody except the government is
prohibited from carrying letters and packets&mdash;but what are “packets?” A letter
is a letter; but what is a packet?</p>

<p>Foolish question? Yes, it ought to be&mdash;but it isn’t. The whole express
business rests upon the answer to this question. When the law was enacted, <i>there
was no doubt</i> about the meaning of the word packet, because there were no express
companies to raise the question, and everybody knew that packet was a synonym,
used more frequently then than now, for “parcel.” Express companies did not
come along to raise the question until forty years ago.</p>

<p>Even the express companies, when they began business, had no doubt about
the meaning of the word “packet.” This is proved by the fact that whenever
they handled packets, they required shippers to affix postage stamps. But
recognition of the government’s mail monopoly had a strong tendency to curtail
express business, and there came a time when the express companies decided to
evade the law, leave off the stamps and openly compete with the government.</p>

<p>See how ridiculous the express companies have since made your government.
In 1883, a mail carrier who had stolen tea from a packet, made the defense at his
trial that since a packet of tea was neither a letter nor a parcel, the law which
prohibited tampering with sealed letters or parcels could not be invoked against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
him. United States Judge McCreary, who sat in the case, was not so minded.
He told the jury to disregard the prisoner’s defense. In other words, a package
was not only a parcel, but presumably a packet. The judge split no hairs about
definitions. The mail carrier had stolen tea. That was enough. He was sent
to prison.</p>

<p>See how another judge, years later, construed “packet.” Nathan B.
Williams, of Fayetteville, Ark., brought suit in the United States Circuit Court to
prevent express companies from carrying packets. When the last judge had had
his guess about the conundrum, Mr. Williams was judicially informed that the
government mail monopoly, so far as packets are concerned, extends only to
“packets <i>of letters</i>.” In other words, a packet is a packet of letters; that and
nothing more. Here are the judge’s words:</p>

<p>“While Congress has full constitutional powers to reserve to the postal
department a monopoly of the business of receiving, transporting and delivering
mails, and, in the exercise of such rights, may enact such laws, regulations and
rules as will effectively preserve its monopoly, yet this monopoly is intended (see
the Judge read the mind of the Congress of 1845), to extend only to letters,
packets of letters, and the like mailable matter, and Congress has never attempted
to extend this monopoly to the transportation of merchandise in parcels weighing
less than four pounds, nor to prohibit express companies from making regular
trips over established post routes, or from engaging in the business of carrying
such parcels for hire.”</p>

<p>That is what the court says&mdash;and what the court says goes. Here is what
the present Attorney General of the United States says&mdash;and what the Attorney
General says does not go. The Receivers’ and Shippers’ Association of Cincinnati
asked the Attorney General to join in Mr. Williams’ suit, which the Attorney
General declined to do for this reason:</p>

<p>“The department has made a very complete study of the proposition and
agrees with Mr. Williams upon the law, except as to the one point, namely,
that there has been an <i>administrative construction against the proposition for over
forty years</i>, and the chances are that a suit will be defeated on that ground.”</p>

<p>In other words while the Attorney General believes the express companies
have been and are violating the law, the postoffice department, for forty years,
<i>has let them do it</i>, and it seems useless to try to enforce the law.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the absurd situation with regard to packets into which the
express companies have forced the United States government:</p>

<p>If a packet contains tea, and a mail carrier steals some of it, it is a packet
without doubt, and the mail carrier is sent to prison.</p>

<p>If an express company carries a packet of tea, the packet is not a packet,
because a packet is only a packet of letters.</p>

<p>But a mail carrier will find out rather quickly, whether a packet of tea weighing
less than four pounds, is a packet or not, if he carry the packet for his own
profit instead of turning over to the government the amount of the postage. Let
the fact become known to the government, and he will be arrested as quickly as
an officer can reach him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Now: Is or is not this juggling with the law? If it is not juggling with the
law, what, in your opinion, would be juggling with the law? If the foregoing
decisions sound like good law to you, perhaps you ought to be upon the federal
bench. You might shine as a judge. You don’t shine as a voter. You think,
but you don’t act. You don’t put your thought behind your ballot. You let
somebody else put his thought behind your ballot.</p>

</div>

<p>That is pretty plain talk&mdash;talk which should do us readers some
good. It should, at least, enlighten us as to these facts.</p>

<p>First: The express companies have been <i>criminally</i> trenching
upon and into the service of the Postoffice Department for forty years
or more&mdash;have been <i>raiding</i> what were originally intended to be the
legitimate and legally protected revenues of that department.</p>

<p>Second: Such raidings have been winked at by our federal
legislators and condoned, and the raiders exonerated by juridic
opinions which were so bald, bare, brazen and <i>cheap</i> that they would
make a practiced confidence or get-rich-quick man blush.</p>

<p>I intended to write further here about this raid of the express
companies on postal revenues, but have concluded to defer much of
what I intended to say in handling this phase of our general subject to
the closing division of this volume&mdash;the parcels post. One reason for
doing so is that today it is <i>not</i> the express companies which command
and direct the raidings that <i>express business</i> is making, and for some
years has made, into what rightly and <i>legally</i> should be the field of
postal revenue gathering. Twenty years ago, a trifle more or less,
when John Wanamaker was Postmaster General, he stated to a
committee or delegation calling on him, that there were four insuperable
objections to the establishment of a parcels post at that time.
He named the four objections. They were, if I remember rightly,
“The Adams Express Company, the American Express Company, the
Wells-Fargo Express Company and the United States Express
Company.” It may be he named the Southern or some other express
company instead of the United States Express Company. I cannot
remember. At any rate he named <i>four</i> express companies as the
“insuperable objections” to the establishment of a parcels post.</p>

<p>Well, he was right for the period in which he spoke. But twenty
years is a long time in a swift, governmentally aided get-rich-quick
age or country like ours. There are some dozen or more express
companies now&mdash;a dozen or more <i>on paper</i>&mdash;<i>quasi</i>-express
companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The railroad companies and railroad officials <i>control the express
companies and the express business of this country today</i>.</p>

<p>A departmental report of the government showed, as stated in
the Saturday Evening Post of May 27, 1911, “that the four principal
express companies have thirty-seven directors, of whom <i>thirty-two</i>
are residents of New York, <i>two</i> are residents of Chicago and <i>three</i> of
San Francisco. <i>These express directors are also directors in twenty-five
of the leading railroad systems of the United States.</i>”</p>

<p>So, today, if Mr. Wanamaker were inclined to do so, he would
probably revise his statement of twenty or more years ago. He would
probably say that the <i>railroads of this country</i> stood as the insuperable
objection or obstruction to the establishment and operation of an
efficient, cheap and serviceable parcels post&mdash;the failure or neglect
to do which is running one of the greatest raids into postal revenues
this or any other nation has ever known.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert W. Atwood in writing to this point under the general
caption “The Great Express Companies,” in the American Magazine,
February, 1911, issue, says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Perhaps you have thought of all this before, but do you also know that the
six largest express companies are among our greatest bankers? With them, in one
year, the public has deposited $352,590,814 and their transactions in money
orders, travelers’ checks, letters of credit and bills of exchange rival those of the
most powerful banks. This business, unlike any other form of banking is under
no governmental jurisdiction and goes untaxed. It is made possible only by
using the machinery of the regular banks, although to these the express companies
pay no revenue. In the money-order line, express companies compete
with the postoffice and do about one-third as much business as the government.
The American Express alone has handled nearly 17,000,000 money
orders in one year. That the public has confidence in the safety of the express
companies as banks admits of no doubt, and it has been credibly reported that in
the panic of 1907 money was withdrawn from banks, which the people did not
trust, and invested in express money orders.</p>

<p>Transportation in a multitude of forms and branch banking do not comprise
the sum total of express activities. The surplus funds of these huge institutions
have grown large enough to require constant investment, and the express
companies form a close second to the savings banks and insurance companies
as the most dependable, regular and important class of investors in railroad
securities. Diversified as the functions of the express companies have become,
success has more than kept pace with their extension into varied fields, and a
keen, wideawake public interest in the express business is demanded, not alone by
the public and necessary character of the business itself, but still more by the
extraordinary return which the companies receive for service performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Six companies control more than 90% of the country’s express business,
and of these the Adams is one of the oldest and most powerful. Organized more
than fifty-six years ago, its capital stock had grown to $10,000,000 by 1866, in
which year the members of the association, as the shareholders are called, received
a stock dividend of $2,000,000. The $10,000,000 of stock itself did not represent
shares issued for cash. According to the company’s own reports, no shares were
ever issued for cash. The 100,000 shares were given to members of the association
to represent each member’s pro rata ownership in the assets which had
accumulated from earnings. As late as 1890, according to the census figures, the
company had an actual investment in property employed in its business of but
$1,128,195. Yet it had been paying 8% dividends for many years, or 80% on the
actual value of the property in use. In 1898 it distributed $12,000,000 of its
own bonds to stockholders, these bonds to be secured by the deposit in trust of
the surplus funds not used in the express business. At this time the company
reduced its dividend rate to 4%, but as 4% was also paid on the bonds, the
stockholders did not suffer any loss of income. By 1904 the dividend rate had
mounted to 10%, the bond interest remaining at 4%. In 1907, $24,000,000
additional bonds were given to the stockholders, likewise secured by another fat
surplus, and like the first issue, paying 4% in interest. Dividends on the stock
have since been maintained at 12% and there has grown up another surplus of
nearly $25,000,000 which must soon be disbursed. Meanwhile the property
actually employed for express purposes has grown to but something more than
$6,000,000.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is another large fund slowly but surely accumulating in
connection with the 1907 bond distribution. This 1907 gift to the shareholders
was in the form of a bond issue secured by the deposit of stocks and bonds of
other corporations formerly owned by the company itself. The deed of trust
provides that if the income from these stocks and bonds is more than enough to
pay interest of 4% a year on the $24,000,000 of Adams Express bonds, the surplus
shall accrue and be distributed in 1947 among the holders of the Adams Express
bonds. As a matter of fact there is a computed excess income derived in this way
of $151,517.50 a year and by 1947 this will have mounted up to more than $6,000,000,
not allowing for compound interest. Here is a 50% extra dividend being
nourished along toward maturity. If there is any better example of being able
to eat one’s cake and have it too, I have yet to hear of it.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the civil war the Adams Express Company turned its
routes in the Southern States, in which it had enjoyed a complete monopoly,
over to the Adams-<i>Southern</i> Express Company, <i>created by the Georgia courts for the
purpose of assuming this business</i>. The property of the association was to be
represented by 5,000 shares, of which 558 were then issued. The Adams Express
Company has held to the present day a dominant interest in this association,
which it created to facilitate business <i>during the war</i>. After hostilities ceased, it
resumed some of its Southern routes by agreement with the Adams-<i>Southern</i>
Express Company, whose name had meanwhile been changed to the <i>Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Express Co.</i> The two companies still work in common and use the same wagons
and offices in many places.</p>

<p>But close as the Southern Express is to its parent company, it has a separate
enough existence to justify a separate account of its <i>money-making capabilities</i>.
Referring to the original 558 shares of stock, the secretary and treasurer of the
Southern Express says: “<i>None of the original twenty-four stockholders are living
and there is no existing record to show how much was realized from the distribution.</i>”
This does not help us much, but in another report to the Interstate Commerce
Commission the company appears to know what these records showed, for it says
“<i>none of its stock was ever issued for real property</i>, equipment, acquisition of securities,
or for any other purpose in the sense in which the issuance of stock is
understood in connection with corporations.” But we do find that in 1866 the
number of shares was increased to 30,000 and distributed to the owners <i>as a
stock dividend</i>. Plainly, the civil war did not impoverish the express carriers.
Then in 1886 enough more new stock was created to give the owners five shares in
place of every three which they already held, so that there are now 50,000 shares.</p>

<p>Five hundred and fifty-eight shares of stock, the circumstances of whose
issue are known to no one living, have sprouted into 50,000 shares by the mere
process of <i>paying stock dividends</i>. Dividends of 8%, or $400,000 a year, are now
paid upon the 50,000 shares, although the entire value of the company’s property,
real estate, buildings, equipment, furniture, etc., was only $944,179 <i>on June 30,
1909</i>. Here are dividends of 8% on $5,000,000 stock, or more than 40% on the
value of the property employed in the business. And this is not all. The Southern
Express Company owns high-grade stocks and bonds valued at almost
$4,000,000, which may some fine day form the basis of another melon.</p>

<p>If the Adams Express Company and its Southern associate were the only
ones to shower their members with unheard-of profits we might be inclined to
think they had been visited with peculiar and exceptional good fortune. Such
is far from being the case. Let us proceed alphabetically and see how the members
of the American Express Company have fared.</p>

<p>The Adams and American are easily the two most important of the express
companies, and control, or have controlled at various times, all the other important
companies with the exception of the Pacific. Since 1868 the capital of
the American has stood at $18,000,000, this stock having been issued in exchange
for the shares of the original American Express Company and the Merchants’
Union Express Company, under articles of merger and association dated November
25, 1868. The company’s books show that $5,300,000 <i>was the value</i> of the
assets taken over at that time. There was $183,819 in cash; $1,261,023 in securities;
$2,200,300 in real estate, less a mortgage of $505,143; and $1,260,000 in
equipment; making a total of $4,400,000. New stock was sold which realized
$900,000 in cash, making a total of $5,300,000 in assets for the $18,000,000 of
stock. <i>No new stock has been issued since 1868 and no further cash has been paid
into the treasury except from earnings.</i></p>

<p>From its own balance sheet we find the company now has less than $10,000,000
in <i>real property and equipment</i>, all of which does not represent property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
employed in the service, <i>because the item “real property” includes real estate
investments</i>.</p>

<p>With an original investment in cash and property of but one-third the par
value of its capital stock, the American Express Company now pays dividends on
this stock of 12% a year and for many years paid 6, 8 and 10%. Moreover, it has
accumulated from its earnings a fund of <i>more than $20,000,000</i> which is invested in
readily negotiable stocks and bonds, the yearly income on which amounted to
$1,178,000 in 1909. Among these securities are such high-grade railroad stocks
as Chicago and Northwestern, Northern Pacific, New Haven, New York Central
and Union Pacific.</p>

<p>Six years ago (1904-5), the substantial assets of the American Express
Company had grown from $5,300,000, the amount fixed in the articles of association,
to <i>six times that amount</i>. These assets, let me repeat, did not represent new
capital put into the business, for <i>none whatever</i> was put in, but were accumulations
of earnings over and above funds required to carry on the business and pay
dividends of 8% upon $18,000,000 of stock. Even the association’s own shareholders
failed to see the need of such a treasure and in 1906 a committee representing
them addressed the officers of the company thus: “<i>It is evident the
management has faith in its ability to conserve the vast fund so accumulated beyond
the needs of the business, without wasting the same or embarking it in new and
dangerous ventures, and while we personally neither criticise them nor express any
want of confidence in them, still it is our opinion, and that of many representative
holders of long standing, experience and means, that this immense fund should not be
further rapidly increased to become a source of temptation to the possible weakness or
a snare to the possible inexperience of their successors.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>I would like to quote further from both Mr. Benson and Mr. Atwood.
The former writes two articles which appeared in Pearson’s
Magazine in February and March, 1911, clearly showing not only
why we have no parcels post, but, to some extent, the raid which the
express companies have made and are making on postal service
revenues that rightfully and <i>legally</i> should accrue to the government.
The latter, Mr. Atwood, speaks in three splendid articles in the
American Magazine (February, March and April), under the caption,
“The Great Express Monopoly.” Each of the gentlemen handles his
subject masterfully. Each of them set forth facts which every
American citizen should know and, knowing, should <i>go after</i> every
public official who has ignorantly permitted or knowingly condoned,
aided or cloaked the criminal raiding into the legitimate field of the
postal service and revenues. Every one who can should get hold
of and read the five articles referred to. I shall probably quote
further from them in the closing division of this volume, but to
appreciate them fully one should read them entire and connectedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Sufficient has here been said, however, to show any fair-minded
reader that our express companies, or the railways which use the
express companies merely as pinch-bars to pry into our postal revenues
on the one hand and as cloaks for excessive rates to the general
public for handling light or parcels freight on the other, are illegally
taking <i>millions of dollars annually</i> for a service which should be, and
which was originally intended to be, rendered by the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>I say that the express companies, or the railroads over which they
operate and which, today, virtually own and control them, are doing
an <i>illegal</i> business&mdash;a business carried on in flat contravention and
defiance of the <i>plain letter</i> of the federal statutes.</p>

<p>I say further: The contravention of law which makes this vast
lootage&mdash;<i>steal</i>&mdash;possible has no other basis for its past and present
raiding of the field of postal revenues than <i>corrupted federal legislators</i>
and, either corrupted or loose screwed, juridic opinions which
are permitted to stand in place of the plainly worded statute of 1845.</p>

<p>And there is a colossal irony in the brazen effrontery with which
this raiding of the postal revenues by the express companies has been,
and is, carried on.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we have public officials cackling about its costing
the government 4 to 9 cents a pound to transport and handle second-class
mail matter&mdash;rather, making voluble and voluminous <i>guesses</i>
that it costs from 4 to 9 cents a pound&mdash;while on the other hand, the
express companies enter into contracts with publishers to carry and
deliver at line stations that same second-class matter at <i>one-half
cent a pound</i>.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the express companies must “split”
with the transporting railroad to the extent of 40 to 63 per cent of
their gross haulage and delivery charge, the talk of its costing the
government 4 to 9 cents to do what the express companies do for a
half-cent&mdash;in some cases possibly, for less even than that&mdash;passes,
from the domain of irony and becomes disgusting twaddle.</p>

<p>The postal rate for carrying merchandise parcels not exceeding
four pounds is 16 cents a pound. That rate is, as previously stated,
outrageously high and the maximum weight of four pounds is almost
as outrageously low. Both the postal weight and rate have been
held for years at the figures named, it has been numerously asserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and is <i>generally believed</i>, by the “influence” of express company and
railroad lobbying in Congress. The result is that by far the larger
portion of light or parcels shipments go by express instead of by mail,
as it was clearly intended in the law of 1845 they should go.</p>

<p>To get this business, the express companies cut under the
government charge of 16 cents a pound, as they can both easily and
profitably do.</p>

<p>Nor do they hold the shipper to a maximum of four pounds for
any single package or parcel. In fact, they set up practically no
maximum parcels weight, and they deliver at any postoffice or station
along their lines of service. In fact, again, the express companies
now have, it is asserted, a sort of compensating agreement by which
the company collecting the business can have another company make
deliveries, each company taking its prorated share of the profit on
the carriage and handling of the parcel or consignment.</p>

<p>Such arrangement, it will readily be seen, enables the express
company to accept package consignments for delivery at almost any
point in the country, if on a railroad, or for delivery at some rail point
near the addressed destination of the parcel.</p>

<p>Then, too, as Mr. Benson points out, the railroads and railroad
officials and owners are also controlling owners of the express companies.
Being so, they do not hesitate virtually to “club” the public
into shipping its parcels freight by express. They do this by fixing a
minimum weight in their freight tariffs. That minimum is 100
pounds. That is, it will cost the shipper as <i>much to send a four or
ten pound package to destination by fast freight as it would cost him
to send 100 pounds</i>.</p>

<p>The foregoing is sufficient to show the reader that the express
companies are <i>permitted</i> to raid the legitimate business of the Postoffice
Department&mdash;or what should be and, under the law, was
<i>intended</i> to be the business of the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>The express companies, or their railroad control&mdash;which amounts
to the same thing&mdash;also forage the field of third-class matter which,
<i>by law</i>, was made a preserve of the Postoffice Department.</p>

<p>The postal rate for third-class mail matter is eight cents per
pound. That rate is, of course, away too high. With The Man on
the Ladder the conviction remains, as it has been a conviction for
twenty or more years, that the postal rate of eight cents per pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
for third-class matter is three times what that rate should be&mdash;easily
double the charge that should be made to cover the <i>legitimate</i> cost to
the government for handling it, which cost is <i>all</i> that the department
should seek or be <i>permitted to</i> collect.</p>

<p>Trusting that the reader will find excuse for me, I desire to repeat
here what, in substance, I have written into an earlier page:</p>

<p>The postal service of the nation should not be made a revenue-producing
service, any more than the War, Navy, Interior, Justice or
other departments of the federal service should be made revenue-producers.</p>

<p>If the people pay&mdash;have paid and are willing to pay&mdash;the <i>actual</i>
cost of an efficient, honestly administered and managed postal service,
that is all they should be asked or expected to pay.</p>

<p>But returning to the express companies’ raidings into the postoffice
revenues, let me here assert what every observant citizen of
intelligence knows: The express companies are today carrying
<i>millions of pounds</i> of books&mdash;leather, cloth and paper bound books&mdash;at
a rate for carriage and delivery materially below the government’s
excessive rate of eight cents a pound.</p>

<p>These same express companies are today carrying <i>thousands of
tons</i> of catalogues, pamphlets, business, political and other circulars,
color prints of apparel fabrics, etc., etc., which the Postoffice Department
ought to handle&mdash;and, under the law, <i>should</i> handle, and, but for
that extortionate rate of eight cents a pound <i>would</i> handle.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly asserted by persons who are familiar with
carriage and handling costs, both in the postal and private service,
that the postal rate of 8 cents a pound for third-class mail matter has
been maintained&mdash;and <i>is</i> maintained&mdash;by reason of corrupt and
corrupting influences (the coat-pocket “dropped roll,” the “job”
bribe, the “deposit slip,” etc., etc.), which express and railway interests
have liberally exerted upon federal legislators and upon executive
and judicial officeholders&mdash;exerted upon “public servants.”</p>

<p>However, that may be, the facts today are that the postal service
rate of 8 cents a pound for third-class matter is so excessive&mdash;so
conspicuously above the cost of the service rendered&mdash;that the express
companies find no difficulty in under-cutting it&mdash;in many
cases, <i>more</i> than cutting it in half&mdash;and still reap <i>millions of profit</i>
from the handling of such matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>If a publisher has an edition of five, ten or one hundred thousand
of a book to be delivered in piece, or single copies, an express company
representative will see him at once&mdash;often see him before the book is
from the press. If the publisher is doing a large and general business
in book publishing or the book trade, the express companies have
already seen him, by representative, and a carriage and handling
charge agreed upon, under which the contracting or agreeing express
company will handle any or all the publisher’s books, both single
copies and trade shipments, at a rate much below the government’s
postage rate of eight cents a pound.</p>

<p>If a publisher brings out a book which weighs, when wrapped or
jacketed for mailing, say one pound on which the mailing charge
would be 8 cents, the express company tenders a rate of 7 cents. If
the edition of the book is a large one the express company will tender
a rate of 6 cents or even a rate as low as 5 cents or 4 cents.</p>

<p>In performing such service the express company is a violator of
<i>law</i>&mdash;<i>a brazen outlaw</i>. Yet the government not only permits this outlawry,
but, by maintaining that excessive rate of 8 cents a pound, the
government virtually <i>invites</i> it.</p>

<p>What I have above said applies with equal or even greater force
to the transportation and distribution of mercantile and other catalogues,
and of descriptive pamphlets, etc. However, I think sufficient
has been said to cover the point raised.</p>

<p>The government <i>persists</i> in charging a third-class rate which
virtually drives <i>thousands of tons</i> of third-class matter to the express
companies. The express companies handle this vast tonnage at a
cost charge to the sender or shipper, ranging from 16⅔ per cent to
50 per cent <i>below</i> the government’s mail rate.</p>

<p>The express companies roll up millions&mdash;many millions&mdash;of
profits every year, while at the higher rate, the government officials
(some of them), slash up the ambient with rapier verbiage about
“deficits” and make extension-ladder guesses at what it “actually
costs” the Postoffice Department to carry and handle a pound of third,
or some other, class of mail matter.</p>

<p>Another raid upon the postal revenues&mdash;and the raid is by the
oldest gang of looters in the game&mdash;or graft&mdash;is the railroads.</p>

<p>For lo, these many years, the railroads have carried the mails
at a carriage charge of $21.37 a ton per annum per line mile of haul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
That is $21.37 is allowed on “dense” traffic lines where the daily
mail weight is above 5,000 pounds. On lines where the daily weight
is 5,000 lbs., the rate is $171.00 per annum per line mile of haul. For
mail weights less than 5,000 pounds the rate of pay varies, the ton-mile
rate increasing from 21.37 cents for a weight above 5,000 pounds,
to $1.17 per ton-mile for an average weight of 200 pounds.</p>

<p>Following are tabulations showing the scale of mail pay and also
the postoffice car rental pay. I get them from the Wolcott Commission
report made in 1901. The tables and accompanying paragraphs
form part of the testimony of Mr. Marshall M. Kirkman, who
at the time of the Wolcott Commission hearings was Second Vice-President
of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. The rates of
pay may have been modified in some slight degree since 1901. If so,
I have not learned of the fact. I am of the opinion that the figures
given by Mr. Kirkman still govern as rates of mail pay and car
rentals, and as Mr. Kirkman was speaking for the railroads the reader
may depend upon it that the case of the railroads&mdash;especially of the
Chicago and Northwestern, then a system of about 5,000 miles of
trackage&mdash;was presented in as favorable a light as the governing
facts would permit:</p>

<p>The first column, which shows the rate paid per mile of track per annum, is
likely to be misunderstood. The compensation seems very liberal, and it would
be so in fact if it were as large as it appears to be. To gain $25 per mile per annum
a 40-foot car must make a round trip over each mile of road per day. If it
only makes one trip over the road each day, it will earn but $12.50 per mile per
annum, as it would be but half of what is known as a line. The statute reads:</p>

<p>“That … pay may be allowed for every line comprising a daily
trip each way of railway postoffice cars, at a rate not exceeding twenty-five dollars
per mile per annum for cars forty feet in length.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Let us here take note what the foregoing tabulated figures mean&mdash;figures
which Mr. Kirkman argued, if I read his testimony correctly,
are too low<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. I have read the testimony of numerous other railroad
representatives, testimony before the Loud Commission, 1898, the
Wolcott Commission, 1901, the Penrose-Overstreet Commission,
1907, and before the Hughes Commission, whose report is not yet
compiled for publication. Each and all of them, so far as I have read
their testimony, argue eloquently that the present rates of railway
mail-pay and car rentals are, if unfair at all, unfair to the railroads&mdash;that
the rates of pay are too low.</p>

<p>In this connection a most peculiar, if not indeed a peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
suggestive, <i>harmony</i> of opinion appears to have existed between the
special pleaders for the railroads in this matter of railway mail-pay
and government officials&mdash;both executive and legislative&mdash;who have
had most to do with fixing railway pay rates. The government has
spent millions of dollars for investigations by commissions, by Senate
and House committees, by inspectors, special agents, etc. Each
commission has heard numerously from the railways. Twenty-seven
of them were in hearing before the Wolcott Commission. The
testimony of Mr. Kirkman, from whom I quote the preceding tabulations,
while varying in phase, phrase and verbiage from the other
railroad representatives, has two essential features common to them
all, or, I should say, three features common to them all.</p>

<p>1. The railroad representatives unanimously oppose any
reduction in the rates for railway mail pay (weights pay), and mail
car rentals&mdash;“space charge,” they call it.</p>

<p>2. They are a unit in declaring that the present rates are too
low, but they as unitedly express a willingness to <i>continue business at
the old rates</i> rather than to contemplate the possibility of a reduction
in them, or even <i>squarely</i> to argue the justice and fairness of such a
reduction.</p>

<p>3. When forced down to “tacks”&mdash;down to specific facts&mdash;by
some interrogating member of the commission before which they are
testifying, these railroad representatives again have a marked
similarity as to “form.” Each comes eloquently forward with his
<i>own</i> set or sets of figures and proceeds to make his <i>own</i> application of
them. But when some commissioner asks for information and enlightenment
as to “net cost,” “relative cost,” etc., of mail carriage
as compared with the cost of express, freight or passenger handling,
the railroad representatives, almost to a man, at once begin to display
a dense denseness that is marvelously wondrous or wonderously
marvelous, as the reader may choose to word it.</p>

<p>The peculiar or suggestive harmony between the opinions of these
railway representatives and the <i>controlling</i> executive and legislative
officials of the Federal Government, is especially conspicuous under
point 2 as numbered above. The railway people plead that the ruling
rates are too low, but are willing to stand for them. However, they
<i>do not want the rates lowered</i>.</p>

<p>The peculiar harmony of opinions just adverted to is ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
evidence, or so it appears to The Man on the Ladder, of this one
fact:</p>

<p>The present rates of pay for railway mail <i>weight</i> carriage are the
rates fixed by the act of 1879. Freight, express and passenger rates
or tariffs have been changed&mdash;<i>have been lowered</i>. The railways did
not want the mail rates lowered and the governmental powers that
be, and have been, were apparently at least, quite willing to take their
view of the matter, even if they did not concur in the numerous half-baked,
threadbare arguments advanced by the railroad people in
support.</p>

<p><i>The rates of railway mail pay have remained the same for thirty-three
years&mdash;until 1908.</i></p>

<p>Comment is unnecessary.</p>

<p>As evidence in support of points 1 and 3 as above numbered,
points on which railroad representatives so uniformly agree in support
of, or, with equal uniformity, display concurring lapses of memory or
lack of knowledge relating to, I shall here quote further from Mr.
Kirkman’s testimony before the Wolcott Commission. In electing
to quote from Mr. Kirkman rather than from another to evidence
points 1 and 3, I am influenced only by the fact that I have the report
of the Wolcott Commission before me at the moment, and to the
further fact that Mr. Kirkman’s testimony appears to me cogently
illustrative of the points to which I have called the reader’s
attention.</p>

<p>In closing his prepared or written testimony (page 208 of the
report), Mr. Kirkman says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In conclusion, it may be stated that the compensation afforded this railroad
for carrying the mail <i>is not now in excess of what it should be</i>. It is not improper,
therefore, for us to beg, if rates can not be increased, <i>that no further reductions
may be made</i>; also, that the practice of fixing the compensation paid for mail
service on the basis of the weight carried at the commencement of the four-year
periods (instead of on the weights carried in the middle of the periods), may be
abandoned in favor of a more equitable system.</p>

</div>

<p>From the above it will be seen that this witness states with
confidence that the compensation his road (the Chicago and Northwestern)
receives “is not now in excess of what it should be” and
<i>begs</i> that, “if the rates cannot be increased, that <i>no further reductions
be made</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall now reprint a few pages from the report of Mr. Kirkman’s
oral testimony as illustrative of point 3:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Catchings</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. What did you state were the gross receipts from your whole system for
carrying the mails?&mdash;A. About $800,000.</p>

<p>Q. Now, can you state to this commission what your net profit was for
carrying that amount over your system?&mdash;A. <i>I do not know.</i></p>

<p>Q. Can you make any estimate?&mdash;A. <i>No, sir.</i></p>

<p>Q. You heard the testimony of Mr. Simpson (representing the Flint and
Pere Marquette Railroad), did you not?&mdash;A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. He stated that his road carried the mails at a dead loss. What that
loss was <i>he was unable to give us</i>. I understand you to say that you do make a
profit out of carrying the mails?&mdash;A. I beg your pardon. I said that, because
we got approximately the same rate per ton per mile for carrying the mails as for
express (and that the express rate had been a matter of careful negotiation as
between our company and the express company); I have reason to believe that we
would not have taken the express business unless we derived a profit from it, and
therefore I think it is reasonable to suppose that we must derive a profit from
the postoffice business.</p>

<p>Q. Do you mean to tell me that you have no estimate as to the cost of
carrying this mail matter?&mdash;A. <i>Not to my knowledge. We have taken what the
Government gave us.</i> As I have shown you, they have never pretended to remunerate
us for many services rendered.</p>

<p>Q. If you are unable to say what your profit was for carrying this mail,
how can you complain that you are not being properly compensated for the service
rendered?&mdash;A. Because we render so many services today that we did not
formerly when the rate was fixed.</p>

<p>Q. I understand; but, so far as we know from your testimony, you may be
amply compensated for it.&mdash;A. We receive, as I said before, a certain rate from
the express company for analogous service, and do not render them anything like
the equivalent that we render the Postoffice Department, so that we must derive
a great deal more profit from the express business than we do from the postoffice.</p>

<p>Q. Still, it would not follow that you were not deriving proper compensation
for carrying the mail, would it?&mdash;A. It would not follow that we do not derive
some compensation from it.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Unless you are prepared to tell us what your profit is, or your loss, as the
case may be, of course you can not expect us to know it, and, unless we know it, you
can not expect us to sympathize with the complaint.</i>&mdash;A. <i>We are not making complaint
about the compensation we receive, but the threat held over our heads that our
compensation would be cut down.</i> When they cut us down on the land-grant roads
they did not make it a matter of negotiation at all; they just simply took off 20
per cent.</p>

<p>Q. Do you not think that the best way to prove this complaint would be
to show that you are not receiving due compensation?&mdash;A. If I was keeping a
boarding house and you came to me and I agreed to give you two meals a day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
you afterwards exacted four, because you are mightier than I in forcing it, would
it be necessary for me to prove that I was giving you something that you were not
entitled to under your contract?</p>

<p>Q. You ought to show us what your net profits are.&mdash;A. <i>It is impossible.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By the <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. General Catchings calls your attention to this: In your direct examination
I asked you if you had any suggestions to make to this commission in the
matter of changes of law. You said you thought the law should be so changed as
to increase your compensation to an adequate sum. Now, in answer to General
Catchings, you say that it is remunerative; he asks you how much you make, and
you can not tell; then he asks you why you recommend a change in the law if
you will not tell the commission what you are now making by it, and if you can tell
what your profits in carrying the mail are. That is what General Catchings is
anxious to have you tell.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Catchings</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. I would like very much to know if we are under-paying these roads;
we would like to pay them.&mdash;A. You ask a question that there is nobody but
Omniscience could answer, because there is no possible method by which you can
determine accurately what the cost is of carrying traffic. The Government did
pretend at one time to divide the expense of operating as between passenger and
freight, but finally abandoned it. Now, if you can not determine the cost between
passenger and freight, how can you determine it between mail and other kinds?</p>

<p>Q. There is one thing certain; if the roads can not determine it, the Government
can not.&mdash;A. Is it not true that, in matters of this kind, no one would
expect anything definite in the absence of definite information?</p>

<p>Q. I do not see why you can not figure as well the cost of carrying these
mails as you can the cost of carrying the express packages. I do not see why it
ought to be more difficult for you to determine that.&mdash;A. There is not any single
thing that a railroad carries, from a first class passenger to a cord of stone, that it
can tell accurately what the cost is. <i>Tariffs are a matter of evolution.</i></p>

<p>Q. At least, your road is better off than the Flint and Pere Marquette, for
they carry at a loss and you carry at a profit&mdash;A. I did not say we carry at a
profit; but I say that is my judgment, sir.</p>

<p>Q. I believe something has been said about the extraordinary cost at which
these railroads handle these postal cars. I would like to have you help me reach
a conclusion from that. How many railway postal cars have you on your system?&mdash;A.
I do not know how many we do have.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By the <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. Does your statement show?&mdash;A. No, sir; it does not.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Catchings</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. How much do you receive from the government for the railway postal
cars?&mdash;A. We receive certain compensation for cars over a given length.</p>

<p>Q. You stated, I believe, the gross revenue to you for these cars?&mdash;A. We
have a great many that we do not receive any revenue from the government for
their use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. I want to know what your revenue is from the postal cars?&mdash;A. I can
not tell you.</p>

<p>Q. You can furnish that amount?&mdash;A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. I wish you would furnish this commission a statement showing the gross
revenue to your system of road derived from these postal cars; and then I wish
you would furnish a statement showing what the cost to you is of maintaining
those cars, keeping them in repair, what the estimated cost to you is of hauling
them, and the number of cars?&mdash;A. I will give you all that you desire so far as I
can.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Loud</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. You stated, Mr Kirkman, that you were Vice-President of the Chicago
and Northwestern?&mdash;A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. Are you General Manager?&mdash;A. No, sir.</p>

<p>Q. What is your particular business in connection with the railroad?&mdash;A.
I have charge of the local finances and accounts of the company.</p>

<p>Q. You are not prepared to answer technically, then, questions that might
be propounded to you, as has been developed in the examination by Mr. Catchings,
about the cost of the operation of a car and the cost of the transportation of a ton
of freight, passengers, etc?&mdash;A. <i>I am as well prepared to answer the question as
anyone. There is no one, as I said before, who knows what the cost is or can tell you
definitely, simply for the reason that it is utterly impossible to fix the cost as between
passengers and freight, for instance.</i></p>

<p>Q. What is the use of our investigation, then?&mdash;A. I am here before this
commission; my time here, perhaps, represents ten dollars or ten cents. <i>What
am I going to charge it to?</i> In this case perhaps to mail. In many expenses of
railroads there are questions impossible to determine as to what expenditures
should be charged to. You may make, as the General has, a comparison between
the Flint and Pere Marquette, what he thinks is an approximate statement of
cost; it may be more, and it may not. For instance, the Government of the United
States requires that the mail shall be carried on fast trains&mdash;</p>

<p>Q You are going into quite an argument. You ought to be able to tell
what it cost to haul the mail.&mdash;A. <i>No, sir; I can not.</i></p>

<p>Q. You can not tell?&mdash;A. No, sir; nobody can tell.</p>

<p>Q. Could not your General Manager give us some information on that
subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Chandler</span>. He can tell how much their gross receipts are and what
the gross expenditures are, and he can tell whether their whole business is done
at a profit or not; but I do not understand that the railroads can subdivide their
receipts and expenditures so as to tell whether any particular branch of it actually
pays a profit or not. The previous witness undertook to do it, and I noticed, as
he went on, <i>that it was mere guesswork</i>. Mr. Kirkman says he never has done it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Witness</span>. I want to say, Mr. Loud, that this question of division of
cost has been up before railroads and experts for forty years, and here is what
the chief engineer of the Pennsylvania says in regard to it. <i>He estimates that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
cost, for instance, of maintenance of track and machinery increases with the square
of the velocity.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By the <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. How much do you charge this maintenance of way?&mdash;A. What is the
wear and tear of machinery and track from the passage of a particular train?
<i>No one can tell nor guess approximately.</i> In an examination of this question I gave
it, probably, the most exhaustive study that I have given any subject in my life,
because so much depended on it&mdash;I searched all the records of Scotland and
England and of the United States to determine, but unavailingly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Loud</span>:</p>

</div>

<p>Q. Could you not put a train of five cars on and run it from Chicago to
Council Bluffs and give approximately what that train would cost to operate and
the approximate cost of wear and tear to your rails?&mdash;A. I can determine all
those things that are apparent; that is, the cost&mdash;</p>

<p>Q. That is all we expect; what is reasonable.&mdash;A. <i>But then there is the
question of interest and the wear and tear of machinery and track.</i></p>

<p>Q. Let us discard the interest. You ought to be able to get at the cost of
operation.&mdash;A. That train so run has to receive the <i>constant attention of station
men, of track men, the whole length</i>. If you will give it a moment’s reflection you
will see how <i>utterly impossible it is</i> to determine it accurately enough to state here
to this commission.</p>

<p>Q. Approximately, it ought to be a perfectly easy matter. It seems to be
to other railroad men.&mdash;A. I do not think there is any railroad man who has given
it any more attention than I have and no railroad man understanding the subject
<i>will do more than guess at it</i>.</p>

<p>Q. I will ask you a few questions. If you can answer them I wish you
would. How many miles of land-grant railroad have you?&mdash;A. My impression
is that we have about 600.</p>

<p>Q. Out of your total of 5,000 miles?&mdash;A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. What is the average charge on your road for freight per ton mile?&mdash;A.
Last year ninety-nine one-hundredths of a cent per ton mile.</p>

<p>Q. You do not know how much it costs? That is correct, is it not?
You do not know how much it costs?&mdash;A. <i>That is correct.</i></p>

<p>Q. You do not know how much it costs to operate a 40 or 60 foot mail
car?&mdash;A. <i>No, sir; only approximately.</i></p>

<p>Q. Can you say, approximately, how much?&mdash;A. <i>No, sir. It will afford
me great pleasure to give you all this information that can be determined if you desire,
but it is valueless in itself.</i></p>

<p>Q. Can you say approximately?&mdash;A. <i>I can not.</i> I would be very glad to
furnish you all the figures, but such questions, <i>like the cost of the velocity</i> with
which we send trains across the country, <i>are unknown</i>.</p>

<p>Q. Does it cost a dollar a mile as the outside?&mdash;A. I could not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Q. Would it not?&mdash;A. <i>I would not want to pay you the disrespect of saying
a thing that I know nothing about.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing testimony appears on pages 213-216 of the Wolcott
report. The italics are mine. When so well informed a railroad man
as Mr. Kirkman answers questions&mdash;questions covering that which
appears, to a layman at least, to be essential in successful railway
management&mdash;as he is reported in the foregoing, what is to be thought
of such testimony? With all due respect to Mr. Kirkman, it may be
said that his apparently frank confession of ignorance as to several
points made subject of inquiry by the commissioners in the part of his
testimony quoted, many readers of it are left with more or less valid
grounds for doubt&mdash;grounds for asking more or less offensive questions:
“Was the witness telling the truth or equivocating&mdash;stalling
for time?” If he told the truth&mdash;if his acknowledged ignorance was
genuine&mdash;as to several essential factors in the successful management
and financing of a railroad&mdash;then of what value are his&mdash;or any other
railroad man’s&mdash;statistics and tabulations of cost, profits, losses,
rates, tariffs, “cost of velocity,” etc., etc.?</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkman’s reputation for truth and veracity, I believe, is as
high as that of any other railroad man’s in the country, yet on several
basic factors in the problem which the Wolcott Commission was,
presumably at least, trying to solve, he confessed an ignorance as
profound as its members and the officials of the Postoffice Department
acknowledge. If, as Mr. Kirkman virtually testifies, the
information sought is beyond the ken of man, then why persist in
spending thousands&mdash;<i>yes millions</i>&mdash;of money trying to run it down?</p>

<p>If these railroad men do <i>not</i> know the things which it is <i>necessary
to know</i> to arrive at a solution of this railway mail carrying problem&mdash;to
arrive at a just, equitable rate of pay for the service rendered&mdash;why
waste more time on them?</p>

<p>That question brings us back to the <i>rails</i> again.</p>

<p>Why do not our postal officials and commissions reach out to
Cornville and summon a few eighth-grade nubbins? Then turn over
to them the <i>wastefully</i> collected and collated statistics, data and <i>talk</i>
which the Postoffice Department has in cold storage and tell them to
“go to it” at, say, $25 per week?</p>

<p>Yes, why not?</p>

<p>Skilled lawyers, reputed “experts,” men of “experience” and
“students,” it would seem, have told all they know about this railway
mail cost problem&mdash;told the truth or equivocated or <i>lied</i> about it, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the best of their ability and in full accord and harmony with their
several “standards” of veracity. Still they have failed to uncover or
to <i>divulge</i> the essential and governing factors in the problem&mdash;failed
for <i>thirty or forty years</i>. Is it not about time, then, for sensible people,
I would ask, to enter the plea of the Master and say, “Suffer little
children to come unto me?”</p>

<p>Any <i>average</i> “shock” of eighth-grade nubbins from Cornville, or
from other hamlets where the “little red school house” has been in
fairly active operation, will “figger” the cost&mdash;<i>the cost to the railroads</i>&mdash;of
mail haulage and handling, in not to exceed <i>four weeks</i>.</p>

<p>That is, such a bunch of eighth graders will arrive at a dependable
solution of this forty-year-old problem in four weeks, if they are given
the <i>plain, bald facts upon which a correct solution depends</i>, and not
turned loose on a lot of befuddling, alleged data and <i>accepted</i> “testimony.”</p>

<p>As I must necessarily touch upon the <i>raid</i> of the railroads into
postal revenues when I reach the closing division of this volume, I
shall not comment further here on the testimony and special pleadings
presented by railroad representatives to the several postal commissions
that have sat and sat and then “reported.” The commissions
probably&mdash;<i>possibly</i>, if not probably&mdash;reported the best they could
on the evidence presented to them. Certain it is, their reports present
much valuable&mdash;much informative&mdash;data of which neither Congress
nor the Postoffice Department appears to have made any constructive
or corrective use.</p>

<p>Before quitting this railway pay raid, however, it may be well
to do a little figuring&mdash;basing our figures on Mr. Kirkman’s tabulations
of rates, printed some pages back. The tables of rates are
correct. They ought to be. If rate-tables could vote the youngest
of the two was entitled to the suffrage many years since.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But let us
look into and over them in a little-red-school-house way.</p>

<p>The first mail rail-haul weight is 200 pounds. That weight of
mail is carried on some cornfield railroad&mdash;“a feeder.” It is all
bundled or sacked, if “free in country” or other second-class matter,
sacked or pouched if first or third-class, and, also, if valuable fourth-class.
Some of the fourth-class, if large in dimension of package,
may, of course, be loose. But whatever their class, character, pouching,
sacking, casing, or jacketing, that <i>estimated</i> weight (<i>estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
once every four years</i>), is received by the railroad and dumped into a
corner of a “general utility” car. By that I mean a car used for carrying
baggage and express matter, between stations&mdash;jars, buckets,
boxes, bags, etc., of local “favors” or shipments; such as jam, fruits,
eggs, butter, and even “line loafers” who are going to mother, uncle,
or friend for a few days feed, or&mdash;sometimes&mdash;going to the local
metropolis for a “good time.”</p>

<p>But let us, for the moment, stick to that <i>quadrenially estimated</i>
200 pounds of mail. At the several stations along the cornfield or
“feeder” railroad the packages, sacks and pouches of mail are tossed
off to the station agent. Coops of chickens, cases of eggs, tubs or
jars of butter and crates of fruit or vegetables are taken on.</p>

<p>Have you, the reader, ever traveled on a “cornfield line?” Have
you ever “got off to stretch your limbs” at some station between start
or “change” to destination? Have you, while stretching those limbs
of yours, ever noticed or taken note of the miscellaneous and promiscuous
sort of goods&mdash;merchandise and human adipose tissue&mdash;that
get into companionship, into carriage or <i>housed</i> connection, with that
“estimated” 200 pounds of United States mail?</p>

<p>Well, if you have, no argument is necessary to convince you that
the “railway mail pay” rate on that cornfield line is from <i>two to five
times</i> the rate paid for any other weight (tonnage) carried.</p>

<p>Turn back and look at the table of railway mail-pay (weight).
Look at the rate per 100 pound per mile haul&mdash;5.85 cents, or <i>eleven
and seven-tenths cents</i> for carrying 200 pounds <i>one</i> mile.</p>

<p>Do you weigh 200 pounds? If not, our President and several
other gentlemen in this country do, and you, the President, or the
other gentlemen, will be carried&mdash;<i>and for thirty or more years have
been carried on any railroad east of the “Rockies”</i>&mdash;<i>for three</i> cents a mile.</p>

<p>Now, you, the President, or other gentlemen, pay only <i>two</i> cents
a mile for rail <i>haulage</i> on most all of the cornfield or “feeder” lines
(and on “trunk” lines as well), east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>You see the joke of it? The postal revenue <i>raid</i> in it?</p>

<p>Two hundred pounds of United States mail is railroaded in a
general&mdash;a catch-all or pick-up&mdash;car at a government charge of 11.7
cents per mile, while you, the President, or other gentlemen, pay but
3 <i>cents</i>! You, and the other fellows as well, have an upholstered
seat, have watering and toilet facilities and accommodations, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
smoking, “pitch,” “high-five,” “cinch,” “euchre” and, maybe, even
“poker” as divertisements&mdash;with palatable “wets” on the side!</p>

<p>You, the President, and the other gentlemen, have all this
<i>sumptuous haulage</i> for <i>three</i> (or two) <i>cents</i> a mile, while the 200 pounds
(<i>averaged every four years</i>) of United States mail, handled as junk or
dunnage, pays 11.7 cents a mile.</p>

<p>Does it not look&mdash;look to you&mdash;somewhat <i>off</i> at the corners somewhere?
Does it not look as if that railway “system” feeder line
was getting robustly <i>large pay</i> for the service rendered?</p>

<p>Well, if it does not so appear to you, it appears to me that you
should, at your earliest convenience, consult some qualified and
competent alienist, or drop into a “rest resort” for six months or
more.</p>

<p>As to the other weights given in that tabulation&mdash;500, 1,000 and
up to 5,000&mdash;nothing here needs be said. They are all below the
“postoffice car” weights. At the weights, 5,000 pounds per day of
mail-haul, the student of this rail-mail pay <i>raid</i> should sit up and begin
to observe his nurse and the attending physician.</p>

<p>Before I further inflict the reader with personal comments, it
might be of mutual advantage to quote a recognized authority on the
weights actually carried in postal mail cars&mdash;weights of <i>actual</i> mail.</p>

<p>I take the following from the official report of the Penrose-Overstreet
Commission, pages 30-31.</p>

<p>“It is stated in the report of Dr. Henry C. Adams to the former
Commission (Vol. II, 233), that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The average loading of the postoffice car, according to the testimony before
the Commission is 2 tons. It must be admitted, in view of the great weight of
these cars, that such loading <i>pays little regard to the requirements of economy</i>. It is
doubtful if, on the basis of such loading, the railways could afford to carry mail
at a rate much cheaper than it is now carried. On the other hand, if cars were
loaded with 3½ tons, which Mr. Davis says is an easy load, or should the average
load go as high as 6 tons, which, according to testimony, is accomplished on the
Pennsylvania Railroad by a special train, I am confident that <i>railways operate
upon a margin of profit in carrying mail that warrants a reduction in pay</i>.</p>

<p>“For the purpose of emphasizing the importance of loading as essential to the
determination of railway mail compensation, as well as to suggest the line of
desired improvement in the present railway mail service, it may be added that
were it possible to load 5 tons in a car, the expense would be reduced to $1,766
per mile of line; that is to say, a sum less than one-half the amount actually paid.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Adams in the foregoing was presenting a judgmental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
summary, or digest, of the testimony before the Wolcott Commission
on this “railway-mail-pay” question. His opinion, or conclusion, as
to the dominant factors involved, has been recognized as authority&mdash;<i>if
not final authority</i>&mdash;on the points to which he spoke.</p>

<p>Now, let us figure a little more. I’m not much at “ciferin.”
Maybe the reader can help me along. Let’s get properly started.</p>

<p>Those rail “postoffice cars,” of which Dr. Adams spoke, are from
40 to 55 feet or more in length. They must weigh, empty, or
“stripped,” figuring running trucks, body, etc., <i>forty to one-hundred
or more thousand pounds</i>. So, according to Dr. Adams, this twenty
to fifty ton vehicle is sent hurtling over a hundred or a five-hundred
mile run on a steel track with finest and most modern engine or motive
power, baggage and express cars ahead, and sleepers, buffet, diner
and observation cars trailing, <i>to carry two tons of United States mail</i>
in each mail car in the train.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I know that Dr. Adams spoke some years ago (1901, I
believe), and spoke of the “average load” of mail carried by mail
cars then. I also know that our present Postmaster General has
“gone after” this railway mail car raiding&mdash;has made them carry
more load. All praise to him for doing so. It was an action which
<i>any</i> of his predecessors had the power to have taken, and which should
save millions of postal revenues.</p>

<p>The department report for 1910 (P157), states, there were 1,114
full and 3,208 apartment postal cars in service&mdash;<i>rented</i> cars&mdash;while
there were 206 of the former and 559 of the latter (a total of 765),
kept in “reserve.” That makes a total of 5,087 postal cars for which
the government pays rent.</p>

<p>There is, however, another strong presumption&mdash;with some
very robust facts which investigation has uncovered&mdash;that a considerable
number of the so-called “reserve” cars are in the hospitals
about railroad shops, where such patients receive little but “open
air treatment.” In “emergencies” it is legitimate, of course, to
presume that the division traffic manager may order out or put on
the rails any of these hospital cars, “full” or “apartment,” as first
aids to the injured. And it is right that he does so.</p>

<p>But why, in the name of George Washington, should all these
hospital cars be charged up to the Postoffice Department? Yes,
why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I know that they are all in “service” or “reserve”&mdash;<i>all
subject to department orders</i>. But when one looks down from the ladder
top into these shop-hospital yards for car patients, he not unfrequently
sees, unless he is freakishly nearsighted or a victim of a
new brand of strabismus, an old “flat-wheeler” which bears a marked
resemblance to one that he used to, in days agone (long agone),
pause, while husking the “down-row,” and gaze at in admiration as
well as wonderment. Of course, it did not wear “flat wheels” then.
It also carries some mars and scars of time, just as The Man on the
Ladder carries marks which did not stand out so conspicuously then as
now. But there, on its sides, appears, somewhat dimmed by age,
that patriotic, stirring designation: <i>U. S. Mail Car</i>.</p>

<p>This is not intended as a criticism. It is merely a suggestion as
to where the present or some future Second Assistant Postmaster
General may find additional <i>raiding</i> into the postal revenues.</p>

<p>A few years since, Professor Parsons asserted, (so the public press
declared&mdash;I have not the document by me and am writing hurriedly&mdash;the
Professor will, therefore, excuse me if I mis-spell or misquote.
Corrections will be made in later editions) that the railway mail pay
and car rental raid amounted to something like $24,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Speaking again from press reports, Mr. Hitchcock seems to have
been going after those raiders. At any rate he appears to have stopped
that graft sluiceway to the extent&mdash;reports vary&mdash;of from
<i>nine to fourteen millions of dollars a year</i>.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Hitchcock, we say, may your tribe increase&mdash;<i>on
this line of action</i>.</p>

<p>Now let us return and do a little “red-school-house” figuring on
this railroad pay raid. Some pages back, we reprinted Mr. Kirkman’s
tables of weight and car rental pay to the railways. You can glance
back and verify the figures when you deem necessary. Here “orders”
force me to hurry. But in spite of orders a few generalizations in
“cipherin,” have to be made.</p>

<p>Many pages back, the Postoffice Department’s <i>own</i> distribution
of mail weights for 1907 (the last preceding “weighing period”), was
printed. For ready reference, we will here reprint it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>A few pages back we figured out how a 200-pound mail weight
haul stacks against, around and up-to a 200-pound <i>human avoirdupois</i>
haul, assuming, of course, that the aforesaid avoirdupois is not casketed
with the mail, express or baggage in front. Well, with that understanding,
the reader may take my previous statements anent those
200 pounds of U. S. mail matter and human avoirdupois&mdash;whether
citizen or imported&mdash;as made. He should also understand that
what was then said fits, of course with a varying application, to the
wheatfield, cornfield, oilfield, cottonfield, timber, tobacco and other
“feeder” fields, which carry our mails at varying rates of pay for
varying weights up to 5,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Now, at the weight of 5,000 pounds (2½ tons), is about where the
“postoffice car” enters, and it is to the mail-carriage-pay the railways
get for this postoffice car service we wish here to “cipher” on a little.
As a start, however, the “example” must be “set.” To do that a
little preliminary figuring must be done.</p>

<p>The quadrennial weighing of the mails is now in progress. The
last preceding weighing was in 1907. In the interim, however, Mr.
Hitchcock, has made some special or test weighing&mdash;a good and commendable
business movement&mdash;of second-class mail.</p>

<p>From these weighings the department, I take it, has arrived at
estimated results more or less satisfactory&mdash;to itself at least. The
1910 report presents a tabulated tonnage of second-class matter on
page 329. A prolix discussion of the cost of handling second-class
mail appears on immediately associated pages. The discussion is a
masterly, a forensic, production, and, outside of Indiana, the habitat
of experts, it may stand out in fair form as a literary production.
Our Third Assistant Postmaster General must, though, have got the
wires crossed or the gear jammed on his comptometer to have reached
those two “answers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sixty-two and a fraction per cent of the total mail is second class.</i></p>

<p><i>To haul and handle a pound of second-class mail costs the government
nine and a fraction cents.</i></p>

<h3>SOME LITTLE RED SCHOOL HOUSE FIGURING.</h3>

<p>Now, let us sit down on the veranda, bring out the little red
school house slates and do some figuring on this railway pay problem,
question, proposition, or whatever the “experts” may choose to call it.</p>

<p>First, there, on page 329 of the 1910 report, it states, “estimated”
on the basis of those 1907 “special weighings,” that there were 873,412,077
pounds of second-class mail carried and handled.</p>

<p>Let’s see! Yes, of course, how simple it is. There’s that 1907
table of percentages, a page or so back.</p>

<p>As it was “figured out” in 1907 <i>by the people who did the weighing</i>,
or who bossed it, we may consider it as dependable as the Third
Assistant Postmaster General’s figures on page 329 of the department’s
1910 report.</p>

<p>The reader will please understand me. I do not mean to say
that either the 1907 or 1910 reports are dependable.</p>

<p>I wish the reader to understand that I understand, or believe,
them both to be merely <i>guesses</i>&mdash;guesses more or less mis-stitched in
the knitting and more or less frazzled and threadbare by reason of
long service.</p>

<p>But they are what we have to “figger” from.</p>

<p>Page 329 of the 1910 report says:</p>

<p>Total mailings (second-class), 873,412,077 pounds.</p>

<p>The 1907 tabulation of distributed mail weights (see table a
few pages back) says that second-class mail, in carriage, is 36.39
<i>per cent</i> of the <i>total mail weight</i>.</p>

<p>Here’s where we put our slates into service.</p>

<p>We’ll first divide (look back at that 1907 table), 873,412,077
pounds by .3638&mdash;that being the percentage of <i>second-class</i> to the
<i>total</i> of mail carried, as reported in the “special weighing” of 1907.</p>

<p>Well, .3638 into 873,412,077 gives us 2,400,802,850 <i>pounds</i> as
the <i>gross mail weight</i> carriage in 1910.</p>

<p>That does not look near so large, nor so <i>questionably</i> peculiar, as
does some other “answers” we are figuring out on our little red school-house
slates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking back to that 1907 tabulated estimate, we find that, of
the total weight carried&mdash;<i>and paid for as mail</i>&mdash;.4308 of that total for
which we patriotic, likewise confiding, kitchen-garden citizens pay
is not mail at all.</p>

<p>A glance at that 1907 tabulation will show us that 43.08 per cent.
of the <i>total mail weight</i> for which the government pays is for “equipment”
and “empty equipment dispatched.”</p>

<p>Now let’s take our slates again and multiply that total weight
2,400,802,850 pounds by .4308. “Well, what’s your answer?”</p>

<p>One billion, thirty-four million, two hundred forty-five thousand,
eight hundred and sixty-eight pounds!</p>

<p>Well, that’s some tonnage, is it not? Of course, as the reader will
readily grab hold of, that tonnage is not, in itself, staged as a “feature”
in this “ciphering.” This is a big country and its tonnages are big,
whether of wheat, corn, pigs, fools, or mail. It is a “curtain”
comparison we desire to have noticed and studied. Look at it, study
it prayerfully, then put your thinker to work for about thirty seconds.</p>

<p>According to the Postoffice Department’s own figures and
estimates, it appears that a total tonnage of 2,400,000,000 pounds
(omitting the tail figures), were handled, and the cost of all <i>paid
for</i> by this grand old government of ours.</p>

<p>Next, let us notice that 1,034,000,000 pounds (tail figures again
omitted), was not mail at all&mdash;sacks, fixtures, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Now, look at it&mdash;the result.</p>

<p>Railroads were <i>paid</i> for carrying 2,400,000,000 pounds of mail.</p>

<p><i>Of that total weight</i> 1,034,000,000 (<i>nearly half</i>) was <i>“equipment”
and “empty” equipment “dispatched.”</i></p>

<p>Beyond the showing of these figures, comment is scarcely necessary
for anyone at all familiar with railway traffic methods and costs&mdash;whether
the haulage is by slow or fast freight or by express&mdash;anyone
will see the <i>raid</i> in it.</p>

<p>Look at that haulage of “equipment,” which the postoffice
revenues pay for! Pay for as mail. Look it over, and over again
and then sit up and do a little <i>hard thinking</i>.</p>

<p>Waters Pearse, of Pearseville, Texas, ships, say ten or twenty
coops of chickens to Chicago. He may ship by express or by fast
freight&mdash;the latter of course, if “Wat” and his friends have been able
to make up a carload. “Wat” consigns his chickens to some Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
house in Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago or elsewhere.
Wherever our friend “Wat” of Pearceville, Texas, ships, or whether
he ships by express or by fast freight, his empty coops will be returned
to him <i>without charge</i>.</p>

<p>If Steve Gingham, in Southern Illinois&mdash;“Egypt”&mdash;has a hen
range and his hens have been busy, Steve will have several cases of
eggs to ship every week or ten days. Well, all Steve has to do is to
take his cases of eggs over to the railroad station. Some express
company will pick them up and take them to Chicago, to St. Louis, to
Cincinnati, or other market. In a few days, about the time Steve
gets the check for his eggs, he’ll find the cases on the station platform
returned to him, <i>without charge</i>.</p>

<p>What we’ve said about our friends, Wat down in Texas, and
Steve in “Egypt,” is equally true of any shipment of any sort of
specially crated fruit or vegetables, of boxed, bucketed or canned
fish, milk, etc., etc. The shipping cases, buckets, boxes or cans are
returned to the shipper <i>without charge</i>. Yet here is this great government
of ours paying the railways for nearly one ton of fixtures and
equipment for every ton of mail (all classes), carried. Fixtures,
equipment, etc., aggregated, in the weighing of 1907 (see tabulation
a page or two back), 43.08 per cent of the total weight for which the
government has paid mail-weight rates for four years&mdash;paid for hauling
those racks, frames, sacks, etc., etc., back and forth over the rail-line
haul <i>every day of the four years</i>.</p>

<p>Railroad people and their representatives have written voluminously,
likewise <i>fetchingly</i>, to prove to an easily “bubbled” public that
the government has been paying too <i>little</i> rather than too much for
the rail carriage of its mails. I have read numerous such vestibuled
productions. They were all good; top-branch verbiage and rhetoric,
so smooth, noiseless and jarless in coupling that the uncritical reader’s
sympathies are often aroused, and his conviction or belief enlisted by
the sheer massive grandeur of the terminology used. Try almost any
of these <i>promotion</i> railway mail-pay talkers and throw the belt on your
own thought-mill while you read. Four times in five the ulterior-motive
writer or speaker will have you rolling into the roundhouse or
repair shop before you know you have even been coupled onto the
train. When you emerge, if your thinker is still off its belt, you will
find yourself about ready to “argue” that the railroads are very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
underpaid, if, indeed, not grossly wronged by the government. I
would like to quote some of the picture arguments from several of
these railway studios but cannot. As illustrative of the general
<i>ensemble</i> of these forensic art productions, I will, however, reproduce
here a gem from one of them&mdash;a bit of verbal canvas so generic and
homelike as to class as a bit of real <i>genre</i>.</p>

<p>The reader will find it in Pearson’s Magazine for June, 1911.
Who personally perpetrated it, I know not, and the magazine sayeth
not. The editor of Pearson’s, however, assures us that the article
from which the following excerpt is made, was “prepared” by the
authority and under the direction of the Committee on Railway Mail
Pay, and as prominent members of said committee the editor gives the
names of <i>Julius Kruttschnitt</i>, Director of Maintenance and Operation,
Union and Southern Pacific Systems; <i>Ralph Peters</i>, President
and General Manager, Long Island Railroad; <i>Charles A. Wickersham</i>,
President and General Manager, Western Railway of Alabama; <i>W.
W. Baldwin</i>, Vice-President, C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad; <i>Frank Barr</i>, Third
Vice-President and General Manager of the Boston and Maine Railroad.</p>

<p>That is certainly a representative quintette of railway artists
and generally recognized as qualified to produce&mdash;verbally&mdash;almost
anything in railway art, from a freehand tariff to a “car shortage”
done in oil while the crops ought to be moving. Am sorry I cannot
quote more extendedly. The following, however, will give the reader
a sample of the “style” and also of the “argument” common to most
of the <i>protective and promotive railway word pictures</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If, as has been reported, a certain railroad president ever did utter the famous
phrase attributed to him, “the public be damned,” the public has more than
gotten even. It does the damning itself nowadays instead, and so effective is its
verdict that we are even confronted with the spectacle of the government itself
bowing to the popular prejudice irrespective of the facts in the case. Undoubtedly
we have become a nation of stone-throwers. To a certain extent this has worked
for the public benefit. Every deserved stone has worked for the correction of
admitted evils. But so rapidly has the public taken to the lately discovered
pastime of stone-throwing that it not infrequently uses its strength like a giant,
and that, we have been told, is tyrannous. Let a corporation raise its head
nowadays and it is greeted by a shower of stones of which perhaps not ten per
cent. are intelligently cast. The only thing to do in such a case is to “duck;”
argument becomes futile in the heat of battle.…</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>That is sufficient to show the “style.” The article then proceeds
to give some mail-service history and to cite a few points wherein by
“arbitrary” rulings the government is grievously wronging the railroads
in under-paying them for the carrying of the mails. The following
is one of the <i>strong</i> points or arguments presented:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Furthermore, the railroads hold that an additional injustice was done in this
connection in the adoption of the present methods of determining the weights.
In addition to the several reductions from the act of 1873 above mentioned, and in
spite of the fact that various government committees admitted their injustice, a
singular order amounting practically to a <i>juggling of weights in favor of the government</i>
was issued under the date of June 7, 1907.</p>

<p>Under the date of March 2, 1907, the following order was issued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the weight of mail is taken on the railway routes, the whole number of days
the mails are weighed shall be used as a divisor for obtaining the weight per day.”</p>

</div>

<p>But under date of June 7, 1907, a surprising order was issued reading as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the weight of mail is taken on railway routes, the whole number of days <i>included</i>
in the weighing period should be used as a divisor for obtaining the average weight
per day.”</p>

</div>

<p>Certainly this is a startling change of methods on the part of a government
which has been attempting to establish a high standard of integrity in the conduct
of all business. Slight as the difference in the wording of the two orders may seem
upon a casual reading, the actual effect is drastic. Under the order of March 2,
1907, the total amount of mail weighed to obtain the average daily weight was
to be divided by the total number of days on which it was handled. <i>Surely
there could be no other fairer basis of determining the average weight.</i> But under
date of June 7, 1907, the system of weighing was changed, so that to determine
the daily average weight of mail the total weight should be divided, not by the
number of days on which it was weighed, but by the whole number of days included
in the weighing period irrespective of whether mails were handled daily
during the whole period or not. <i>As a matter of fact in many cases they were not</i>,
and this arbitrary “change of divisor,” as it is called, further reduced the pay of the
railroads for the transportation of mails by about 12 per cent in addition to the
reductions above mentioned which <i>congressional committees</i> had previously characterized
as unfair.</p>

</div>

<p>There, now. Is not that profoundly and beautifully conclusive?
The strictures, hard and unjust regulations and arbitrary impositions
of the government in the matter of railway mail weights is working
great wrong to the roads; is, in fact, so cutting into their earnings as to
jeopardize their solvency or to force them to raise freight and passenger
rates in order to continue business.</p>

<p>Very sad, very sad, indeed! And how unjust it is for the Postmaster
General so to cut down railway mail pay as possibly to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
down the dividends the railroads have been paying the “widows and
orphans” who own stock in the roads&mdash;stocks and bonds aggregating
two or three times their tangible value. Especially wrong was it for
the Postmaster General to issue and enforce such drastic orders after
“congressional committees” had declared any reduction of the weight-pay
rate “unfair.”</p>

<p>I shall not impose on the reader any extended discussion or
consideration of the quoted bubble talk. A few comments I will
make&mdash;comments which it is hoped will peel off sufficient of the
rhetorical coloring to let the reader see at least enough of the real
subject (the points involved), as will enable him to make a robust
and correct guess at the “ground-plan” of both the sub and the superstructure
the railway talkers and speakers are trying to erect.</p>

<p>First: Every right-minded citizen should&mdash;and when he rightly
understands the matter, I believe, will&mdash;give the Postmaster General
unstinted praise and commendation for the issuance and enforcement
of the two orders which the railway men quote and complain about.</p>

<p>Second: The rail people say the last order (see quotation),
“reduced the pay of the railroads by about 12 per cent.”</p>

<p>Without questioning the veracity of the gentlemen under whose
“authority” that statement is made, The Man on the Ladder, as a
judgmental precaution, shall line up with the folks “from Missouri”
until that 12 per cent is set forth in fuller relief&mdash;until he is shown.
The reader will observe that the railroad authorities quoted merely
say that the “arbitrary change of divisor further reduced the pay of
the railroads.” Whether or not the pay received by the roads <i>before</i>
that order was issued was too low, low enough or too high is not
directly stated by the writer or writers. That it is designed to have
the reader draw the conclusion that the rate was low enough or too
low before that second order was issued is made evident by the reference
to the expressed opinions of “congressional committees”&mdash;opinions
to the effect that the “reductions” forced by the first order
were “unfair.”</p>

<p>Third: The names of many men of both ability and of integrity
have appeared upon the rosters of the Committees on Postoffices
and Postroads of both the Senate and the House during the past forty
years. In face of that fact stands forth in bold relief a fact so bare
and bald&mdash;and so <i>suggestive</i> of wrongs done and doing by the rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
people&mdash;as to remove it from the field of serious debate. That fact is:
For forty or more years the railroad men and allied interests
have by lobbies, or other <i>persuasive</i> means, got the Congressional
Committees (Senate, House and joint), to do about what they
wanted done in the matter of rail carriage and pay for handling the
mails, or to prevent the committees from doing things they did not
want done.</p>

<p>Fourth: That “change of divisor,” covered in the order of June
27, 1907, and which these railroad men accuse of causing a shrinkage
of 12 per cent in the mail-weight pay the roads were receiving under
the order of March 2, 1907, and prior, possibly was based on some
valid reasons or grounds, or upon grounds the then Postmaster
General believed to be valid. I have not before me, at the moment,
any written data or information as to the reasons assigned by the
postal authorities for that “change of divisor”, or whether they assigned
any reasons for the order making the change. I know,
however, of one very good reason there was for making such a change
on several railroads or divisions of roads.</p>

<p>The weighing of the mails was formerly made during a period of
90 to 105 days, or fifteen weeks, once every four years. The law
now permits the Postoffice Department to make special weighings, I
believe. On the average daily mail weight for those 105 days the
postal department based its contract with the roads for carrying the
mails for four years.</p>

<p>Now notice this: The terms of such contracts not only implied
but specifically required a <i>daily</i> carriage of the mail weight for the
number of days designated, allowing, of course, for wrecks, washouts
and other unavoidable interruptions in the movements of trains.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, suppose the Postmaster General discovered
that on a good many mail runs&mdash;“lines” or “half-lines”&mdash;suppose
that the chief of the department discovered a condition on
many mail runs similar to that I personally know to have existed
on a few, in years 1907 and prior. That was, briefly stated, this:</p>

<p>The contract called for a <i>daily</i> carriage of so much mail weight
and the government <i>paid</i> for that per diem carriage, the days of unavoidable
interferences and interruptions included. Suppose that
the postoffice authorities discovered that, by reason of the diversion
of the mails to other lines, the <i>daily</i> mail service was not rendered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
or discovered, as in at least one instance I discovered, that the contracting
road (or roads) gave little consideration to the <i>daily</i> service
clause save during the <i>weighing period</i>, dropping the mail from train&mdash;skipping
a day’s service&mdash;whenever it was to their interests to do so,
and often assigning the most flimsy reasons for so doing or assigning
no reasons at all?</p>

<p>That order of June 7, 1907, would have a tendency to stop that
sort of disrespect and abuse of contract stipulations, would it not?</p>

<p>Fifth: The writer of the article from which we have quoted
appears to have got himself somewhat twisted in his consideration of
that order of March 2, 1907. It seems that (see first paragraph of
quotation) he would have the reader class it among those several
forced reductions which “various government committees” had called
unjust. But, further along, it is stated that “surely there could be no
other fairer basis of determining the average weight” than that furnished
in that order of March 2.</p>

<p>I wonder why the railroad lobby so strenuously opposed that
order of March, 1907&mdash;connived and schemed for its rescinding, until
the order of June 7, 1907, gave the gang of corruptionists something
still more objectionable to the interests they served? Yes, I wonder
why they so hotly opposed that order of March 2? If there could be
“no other fairer basis of determining the average weight” in June,
1911 (the publication date of the article from which we have quoted),
why was it not fair in March, 1907? And why was it not a fair and just
basis for arriving at the average daily mail weights for many weighing
periods prior to 1907? Did anyone ever hear any railway man advocating
the “fair basis” provided in that order of March? Most
certainly The Man on the Ladder never heard of such advocacy. The
railway people did not advocate such a “fair” method of ascertaining
the average daily mail weight their roads carried during a period of
fifteen weeks&mdash;or during any other period&mdash;<i>because they were beneficiaries
of some very unfair methods and practices which gave them
pay for mail weights their roads did not carry</i>.</p>

<p>As I refer later to some of the practices indulged in the weighing
periods, I will here mention only a method used for years prior to the
issuance of that order in March, 1907&mdash;a method of arriving at the
“average daily weight” for the carriage of which the railroad was to be
paid for a period of four years. That method was, though I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
unable to learn that it was ever officially authorized by the Postoffice
Department, to find the daily average for each week covered in the
weighing period and then arrive at the average for the whole period
by dividing the sum of the weekly averages by the number of weeks in
which the mail was weighed.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that is there? Should work out fair and
square, should it not? Well, it did not. The method was all right
in theory and in letter, but a crooked practice was worked into its
application&mdash;worked into it by collusion between crooked railway
and public officials. And the crookedness of the practice was very
plain and bold and bald. It was what in street parlance would be
called “raw.” Here it is in figures:</p>

<p>Take a “heavy” mail line. Say the total mail weight for a week
was, using a round figure, 840,000 pounds or 420 tons. Now dividing
that total by 7, the number of days in a week and the number of days
also on which the mail was weighed, would give a daily <i>average</i> of
120,000 pounds, or 60 tons. That is all clear and straight, is it not?
Most certainly it is.</p>

<p>But the crooked application of the method divided the week’s
total by 6 instead of by 7&mdash;divided the total of seven days’ weights
by six. The railway people, you see, were great respecters of the
Sabbath. They would run trains on Sunday to accommodate the
public and to meet the necessities of their business, which was, and is,
perfectly proper. They would also carry the mails for your Uncle
Sam, which was also right and proper. But their lofty respect for
the Holy Sabbath, or the high esteem in which they held our much
loved and much abused Uncle, was such as induced them to hold up
said Uncle as a respecter of the Sabbath, or seventh day, while they
“held him up” in averaging his mail weights.</p>

<p>In the illustrative example we have put on the slate, the “hold
up” would amount to&mdash;let’s see: 840,000 pounds, or 420 tons, divided
by 6 gives us 70 tons as the daily average for the week, instead of 60
tons, as the actual average was. That is a “hold up” for pay for ten
tons a day&mdash;for 10 tons not carried.</p>

<p>“What did the hold-up amount to in cash?”</p>

<p>Yes, it might be well to follow our hypothetical or illustrative
example to its <i>cash</i> terminal. Well, that is easily and quickly done.</p>

<p>The rate of pay per ton mile per year on daily weights above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
2½ tons is $21.37.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> That ten tons added to the daily average would
give to the railroads, then, just $213.70 in <i>unearned</i> cash each day.</p>

<p>If the contract stood for full four years on such false average, the
railroad would pull down just 1,460 times $213.70 of unearned money
or a total of $312,002 in the four years.</p>

<p>I would, of course, not have the reader understand that our
hypothetical example would fit all railroads. Many, in fact most,
of the mail-carrying roads average in mail weight much below sixty
tons per day&mdash;even below ten tons per day. Some roads were and
are paid for an average above sixty tons. Nor would I have the reader
understand that the crooked practice just mentioned was common to
all mail-carrying roads. There were possibly&mdash;yes, probably, some
exceptions&mdash;some roads that carried so little mail as not to make a
steal of a sixth of its weight-pay worth while.</p>

<p>I would, however, have the reader understand that I mean to
assert that <i>most</i> of the mail-carrying roads were parties to the crooked
method here described and that the hypothetical figures here given
applied, proportionally, to any average per diem weight of mail
covered in the carriage contract, whether it was one ton or a hundred
tons.</p>

<p>I would also have the reader understand me to assert that, so far
as information has reached me, no railroad man, or man representing
the rail mail-carrying interests, ever questioned the “fairness” of the
crooked practice just described&mdash;a practice which looted the government
of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>As a <i>raider</i> into postal revenues, this thieving practice, it must
be admitted, deserves conspicuous mention&mdash;more extended notice
than I have given it.</p>

<span class="smaller">RAIDERS MASKED BY CIVIL SERVICE.</span></h2>

<p>One other raid into the postal revenues I must notice before
passing to a consideration of the parcels post question, in which
consideration of other raids and raiders will be mentioned.</p>

<p>Here I desire to refer to that band of raiders&mdash;thousands in
number&mdash;who are carried on the payrolls of the Postoffice Department&mdash;carried
at salaries ranging into the thousands in many cases&mdash;and
who do little or nothing of service value for the money paid them.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department is a large institution and does a big
business&mdash;a huge business which has much detail and extends over a
vast territory. To handle such a business properly, necessarily
requires the service of a large force of operatives. Most of the work
of the department is of that sort which human brain and muscle alone
can do. The machine can touch but a few of the minor details of the
vast amount of work our Postoffice Department handles. It may
cancel stamps, perforate documents, etc., but it cannot collect, sort,
distribute, carry and deliver mail. It requires human muscle and
brains to do such work. Much of it requires skill&mdash;the trained eye
and hand as well as academic knowledge.</p>

<p>Well, the Postoffice Department employs a large force&mdash;a vast
army of men, and some women, I believe. Counting the employes in
its legal, purchasing and inspection divisions with the postmasters,
assistant postmasters, railway and office clerks, city and rural carriers,
messengers, etc., there must be somewhere around 330,000 people
employed in our federal postal service.</p>

<p>Whether that is too large or too small a force for the <i>proper</i>
handling of our postal service is beyond my purpose here to discuss.
That the business now handled by the department could be far better
handled by 330,000 employes than it now is, and that such a service
force could, if properly directed and disciplined, handle a business
much larger than that now transacted by the department, I do not
hesitate to assert. I base that assertion chiefly on the following
observed conditions:</p>

<p>First: There are frills and innovations in handling the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which take up the time of employes and which have little or no
service value.</p>

<p>Second: There is, not too much “politics,” as Mr. Hitchcock
and his immediate predecessors have modestly but wrongfully called
it, but too much political partisanship&mdash;<i>dirty, grafting, thieving,
partisanship</i>&mdash;not only in the appointment of people to the service,
but also in making partisan, often grafting, crooked use of them after
appointment.</p>

<p>Third: There are too many non-producers&mdash;non-service producers&mdash;among
that army of 330,000.</p>

<p>It is the last, or third, condition named that I shall here briefly
consider, or such observed phases of it as, in my judgment, so trench
into the postal revenues as not only amounts to a raid in itself, but
which also encourages others to graft and loot.</p>

<p>First, I desire to say that there are many thousands in that
postal service, many who are honest, faithful and <i>competent</i> workers.
There are about seventy thousand (69,712 according to the department’s
report for 1910) carriers, city and rural, most of whom work
industriously and efficiently and who are underpaid for the service
they render.</p>

<p>There are about 50,000 clerks employed. Of these, the 1909-10
report says, 16,795 are railway clerks. Quoting the same report,
there were 33,047 postoffice clerks in the service. All or nearly all
of these are employed in the “Presidential” postoffice&mdash;offices of the
first, second and third classes. Of the total number of clerks, 31,825,
are employed in offices of the first and second classes. There were
424 offices of the first class and 1,828 of the second. That placed the
service of 31,825 clerks in 2,252 offices. The report (1909-10), from
which these figures are taken states 5,373 as the number of third-class
offices. The remainder of the reported number of clerks (1,222)
are, it is presumed, distributed among those 5,373 third-class offices.
At any rate, in the statement of expenditures for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1910, the Second Assistant Postmaster General, Mr.
Stewart, presents the following showing of expenditures as compensation
to clerks:</p>

<table summary="Expenditures as compensation to clerks">
  <tr>
    <td>Clerks in first and second-class postoffices (31,825)</td>
    <td class="right">$31,583,587.37</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clerks in third-class postoffices, lower grade</td>
    <td class="right">540,891.31</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clerks in third-class postoffices, upper grade</td>
    <td class="right">663,632.20</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The lower grade of third-class postoffices comprise those which
yield the postmasters an annual income ranging from $1,000 to $1,500
and the higher grades are those with a compensation of $1,600 to
$1,900 to the postmasters. In this connection, it should be noted
that for the fiscal year there was paid, in addition to the amounts
above named, the sum of $325,953.44 for what are called “temporary”
and “substitute” clerks.</p>

<p>Adding these various sums gives a total of $33,114,064.32 paid
for clerk hire for clerks in first, second and third-class offices&mdash;in the
“Presidential postoffice,” or offices to which the President has, by
law or otherwise, been granted or permitted the right to appoint the
postmasters.</p>

<p>As previously stated, there is a total of 7,625 Presidential postoffices
on the payrolls of which are carried the names of 33,047 clerks.
In addition to these are 16,795 railway postal clerks. Beyond saying
that the appointment and advancement of these last-mentioned
clerks have been in the past&mdash;<i>and yet are</i>&mdash;largely influenced by
assistant postmaster generals, superintendents and other chiefs of
division in the Washington or department office and by Senators,
Congressmen and <i>postmasters</i> in offices of the first and second-classes,
I shall not consider them further here, nor do I include them in the
adverse criticisms I shall make of the clerical force and service of the
department.</p>

<p>It should, however, be noted in this connection that in addition
to the 31,825 clerks employed in the 2,252 offices of the first and
second classes, there are 2,237 assistant postmasters. These were
paid $2,536,997.24 for the year ended June 30th, 1910. There were
in offices of the first and second-classes 2,252 postmasters. To these
was paid the sum of $5,814,300. That makes the service personnel
of the first and second class offices, not counting carriers, messengers,
etc., 36,314, and gives a total of annual expenditures for this service
amounting to $40,465,361.56.</p>

<p>The reader will please keep in mind the fact that the foregoing
figures apply only to postoffices of the first and second-classes.
There may be a few clerks and also assistant postmasters in offices of
the third-class. If so, there are so few of them that the department
did not deem it worth while to account for them in that position in
any of its fiscal statements, so far as I have been able to find. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
would ask the reader also to bear in mind that while the following
strictures are intended to apply to all three classes of Presidential
postoffices, their application is less general and less forceful in offices
of the second than in offices of the first class, and less in offices of the
third-class than in either of the two higher class offices.</p>

<p>There has been much talk by Postmaster Generals in recent years
about efforts made and making to get the employes of the Postoffice
Department into the classified service&mdash;getting them under civil
service protection. Not only has this been made subject of urgent
advocacy in almost every annual department report of recent years,
but Postmaster Generals have made prolix and voluble reference to
and favorable comment upon the progress that has been made in
“taking the department out of politics.” Mr. Hitchcock in the 1909-10
report commends highly the progress made in that direction. See
pages 13, 14, 24, 85, 86 and others of the report. The party stump
and banquet oratory of the past twelve or more years has sparkled&mdash;fairly
scintillated it might be said&mdash;with rhetorical coruscations
about what “the administration has done” to remove the federal
service from the “baleful clutch and influence of politics.”</p>

<p>Now do not misunderstand me. I am not saying this because
the Republicans have been in control of things. Had Democrats
been at the helm of the national craft, they would have done the
same. The Democratic politicians might have done more or less
than the Republicans have done to get the civil service of the government
away from corrupt and corrupting partisan influences. The
Republicans have done only what they have been compelled to do&mdash;compelled
by general public demand. So the Democrats would have
done, had they been in power. Politicians do not want a civil service
free from party control. The “jobs” have been and <i>are</i> a source
both of spoils and of continued power to the so-called “practical”
politician of either party&mdash;of any political party. That is why the
party leaders&mdash;“bosses”&mdash;fight so persistently and craftily to retain
control of the civil jobs. That is why almost every civil service law
or “executive order” for placing civil employes under a merit or
efficiency classification carries a “joker” somewhere about its clothes.
That is true of most all such laws and orders so far enacted or issued,
whatever be their field of application&mdash;city, county, state or nation.</p>

<p>So I desire the reader to understand that there is no political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
or party animus in what I may say in adverse criticism of the jokes
and jokers which so conspicuously decorate the Republican display of
effort to place federal postal employes under classified civil service
and which, it is said, “has taken them out of politics and will keep them
out.” The Man on the Ladder believes in civil service, but he does
not believe in either legislative or executive “jokers” which, under
the guise and pretense of establishing a <i>protected</i> merit classification
of public servants, makes stealthy crooks and turns to keep their own
partisans on the jobs, regardless of either their ability, merit or fitness.</p>

<p>Now let us return to our subject&mdash;to the points which make
much if not most of the alleged “progress” in the postal department
toward the institution of a <i>merit</i> classification of its office employes
but little more than a move on lines to keep administration partisans
on postal service jobs, and which makes this much-talked of progress
toward efficiency conserve party more than service interests.</p>

<p>But some readers may urge that this is mere assertion. Well,
let me present a few facts and conditions which support the assertions,
or which, to me, seem to make the statements assertions of fact.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock rightly asserts (page 13 of 1909-10 report) “that
the highest degree of effectiveness in the conduct of this tremendous
business establishment cannot be attained while the thousands of
postmasters, on whose faithfulness so much depends, continue to be
political appointees. The entire postal service should be taken out
of politics.”</p>

<p>Well and good. Following the foregoing, he mentions the fact
that all assistant postmasters have been placed in the classified
service by order of the President. Mr. Hitchcock, “as a still more
important reform,” recommends that “Presidential postmasters of all
grades, from the first class to the third, should be placed in the
classified service.” He also speaks of efforts made and making to
place the fourth-class postmasters under its laws and regulations.
He points out some valid difficulties to be surmounted if such desired
result is attained without impairment rather than betterment of the
service. The First Assistant Postmaster General, C. P. Granfield,
states in his report, that, under an executive order dated November
30, 1908, all fourth-class postmasters in <i>fourteen states</i> have been put
into the classified service. He also explains briefly the method of
procedure in filling vacancies&mdash;<i>when they occur</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>That is probably sufficient preliminary. Now for a few of the
observed and observable conditions which govern in civil service as
thus far applied in the Postoffice Department. Taking the fourth-class
postmasters first, it may be said the method of appointing such
postmasters by civil service examination scarcely rises to a dignity
entitling it to serious consideration. While the method itself <i>reads</i>
well, its application, in many instances, is but a joke&mdash;a tame joke
at that. Postmaster General Hitchcock substantially admits, as
previously stated, that conditions are met with which make its
application extremely difficult if not quite impossible.</p>

<p>Certain it is that, so far as applied, the results have given a vast
majority, if not all, of the certifications to persons of administration
party affiliation.</p>

<p>Then, too, it might be asked by a person addicted to the habit
of doing his own thinking&mdash;a habit very obnoxious to party “leaders”
and to politicians of the so-called “practical” breed&mdash;it might be
asked by any capable, independent thinker, if it was mere chance that
selected twelve administration and two “doubtful”&mdash;chronically
doubtful&mdash;states in which first to make application of a civil service
method to the selection and appointment of fourth-class postmasters?</p>

<p>While there are, according to the last published department
report, about 52,000 fourth-class postmasters in the country, a great
majority of them are persons of little or no local political influence.
Beyond their own votes, then, they are of little service to the administration
party, save as distributing or disbursing agents of the
party in power for its campaign literature and other promotion
matter. They are used also to keep the county and state “bosses”
of the party advised of local political conditions as they view them&mdash;flurries
in the party atmosphere, as indicated by hitching-post and
whittling discussions of party legislation and proposed legislation or
of party policies, as set forth by the published utterances of state
and national “leaders.”</p>

<p>In such and other minor ways, then, the fourth-class postmaster
may be a helpful instrument in the retention of power by the political
party in power&mdash;the party from which he has received appointment.
So it is good “practical” politics to keep such a party agent on the
job. To that end, then, the party in power&mdash;the administration&mdash;places
the fourth-class postmaster in the classified civil service, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
making his removal more difficult, if not impossible, in case an opposing
party should win out at the polls and take charge of the government.</p>

<p>The foregoing is said, of course, on the presupposition that
every reader knows that a vast majority of the postmasters and other
personnel of the postal service today is of the political party in
power. In saying that the party from which these postmasters and
other postal service employes received their appointments has been
and is using a civil service classification largely, if not wholly, for
partisan ends. I say only&mdash;in fact have already said&mdash;that the
Democratic party or any other party would, if in national control,
make similar use of the civil classification. And such partisan
manipulation of a merit service classification will continue <i>so long
as we fool people will stand for or permit it</i>.</p>

<p>The chief “jokers” woven into most all civil service laws and
executive orders are these:</p>

<p>First: The law or “order” directing the application of a
classification of a service into certain grades, places those holding
positions at the time of the enforcement of such law or order, into
the various grades <i>without any examination as to their merit or efficiency</i>.</p>

<p>Second: Such laws and orders almost universally provide a
promotion or advancement credit for “experience,” and the only factor
or element recognized in the make-up of experience is <i>time</i>. The
number of years an employe has been on his job or in the service is
his “experience.”</p>

<p>Third: Such civil service laws or orders always provide for
examinations&mdash;usually an “entrance” and “promotional”&mdash;and for
“examiners.” Seldom is anything said as to the qualifications of
the persons selected as examiners. Their selection is invariably left
to a “Civil Service Commission,” and the membership of such
commission is as invariably left to <i>partisan appointment</i>. There is
usually a pretense of making such commissions “non-partisan,”
that is, one of three or two of five of the appointed commissioners are
to be of the minority party. Nevertheless, they are <i>all</i> appointed by
the majority party&mdash;the party in power.</p>

<p>All three of these “jokers” are in the government civil service
laws and the extension of those laws to the various divisions of the
federal civil service is left largely or wholly subject to the orders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
President. I object to a classified merit service under such statutory
“jokers.” They provide a service more partisan than efficient.
They permit a payroll raid upon the revenues from which employes
are paid. They retain incompetent, inefficient persons in graded
positions for partisan purposes&mdash;often “grafting” purposes&mdash;rather
than for service reasons. They leave the promotion or advancement
of honest, industrious and competent employes largely, if not wholly,
subject to the will, wish and whim of a partisan appointed or elected
superior or to a partisan civil service commission. They provide for
advancement on an “experience”&mdash;a time service&mdash;which may not,
and which in many cases does not, constitute an experience of any
value whatsoever to the service.</p>

<p>I have said that the office personnel of the government’s postal
service embraces a large number&mdash;<i>thousands</i>&mdash;of raiders on the postal
revenues. I repeat that assertion here.</p>

<p>Most of these raiders occupy the higher salaried positions&mdash;postmasters
of the “Presidential” classes, assistant postmasters,
chief clerks and others who secured their positions through partisan
“pull” or “drag.” These do little work of service value for the
salaries paid them. Many of them are so occupied with affairs of
their party that they have little time for service work even if they were
inclined to do it. Most of them are not so inclined. Many of these
raiders know of&mdash;some of them have been parties to&mdash;railway mail-weight,
contract and other raids upon the department they are
supposed to serve.</p>

<p>But this is only generalization, some one may say. In answer I
say kick off your blanket of apathy. Go do a little investigating
and then do a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;hard thinking. See what you shall
see in even such a modest effort to put two and two together. Visit
a “Presidential” postoffice in your county, preferably the one at the
county seat or the one at the capital or at the metropolis of your state.
These cities are the storm centers of partisan activity, likewise of
partisan manipulations, bubble and crookedness. If you know the
postmaster, so much the better. If you are of the same party affiliation
as the postmaster, still better. If you are not, do not let that
deter you. You visit him to see things for yourself, and an investigator
is not only warranted but fully justified in appearing to be what
he is not. Fix upon some subject of inquiry before you reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
“presence” on that particular “Presidential” P. O. throne. Then, with
ears spread and eyes shrewdly as well as interestedly open, go to it.</p>

<p>The postmaster will be glad to see you if he knows you. If he
does not know you, he will be assumedly glad to see you anyway,
after he learns where you are from and that you have an ingrown
habit of voting the ticket of his party. He may even warm up to the
extent of tendering a box of his favorite brand with an invitation to
smoke up. Then he will probably want to know “how things look
up your way.” It does not make much difference how or what you
answer, so long as it is favorable to “the party.” He is handing you
a case-hardened jolly. You must be gentleman enough to return the
courtesy. “I know you are a very busy man, Mr. Jones, and I must
not take up your time. I want a little information and decided I
would come to the right place to get it,” etc., or something along such
lines will do.</p>

<p>Then ask your question or questions. Preferably let them be
about some detail or details in the handling of “the large business” of
his office. Now you will begin to see things.</p>

<p>The postmaster will press a buzzer button. In response a well
groomed gentleman appears whom, by introduction, you learn is his
assistant. “Fred,” says the postmaster, “Mr. Smith here desires
some information. He is from Brainville and&mdash;well, he is a friend of
ours. Now, Mr. Smith,” with a real “glad-hand” shake, “you go with
Fred. He’ll dig up any information you want, and, now, don’t
forget to call on me the next time you are in town.”</p>

<p>Then you go off with Fred. He sluices a lot of kiln-dried small
talk at you and rounds out with “How are things up at Brainville,
Mr. Smith?” Of course you assure him that things “look good” to
you, or that, in your opinion “there will be nothing to it but counting
our majority.” By this time Fred has steered you to the chief clerk.
To the latter he says, “Here, Baker, shake hands with Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith lives up at Brainville and is one of our friends. He wants
some information. You see that he gets it will you?”</p>

<p>Fred, then, with another ingratiating hand shake, leaves you in
Mr. Baker’s care. To him you state the points on which you wish
enlightenment. “Oh, I see,” says Mr. Baker. “You just come with
me and I’ll have you fixed out.” Then, if it be a postoffice of fairly
large business, he will take you over to some chief or foreman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
division, tells him what you desire to know and instructs him to
inform you. The division boss next takes you in tow and with much
pleased and pleasing talk steers you down the line to some $900 or
$1,200 a year clerk to whom he turns you over. This shirt-sleeved
clerk knows the answer or answers and gives you the desired information
in about three minutes.</p>

<p>Incidentally in your round of the postoffice, you have asked some
conventional questions and have learned, among other things, that
the assistant postmaster, chief clerk, division chief and other top-notchers
in the service are all men of “experience”&mdash;have each been
in the service five to ten years and “know the business from garret
to basement.”</p>

<p>Once outside or on your way home, some questions will begin
swimming a marathon in your think-tank. Such as these for instance:</p>

<p>“Did those top-notchers really know the business of their office?”</p>

<p>“If they did know, why did they troll you around for an hour to
get information which a shirt-sleeved <i>worker</i> gave you in three
minutes?”</p>

<p>“If they did not know, then what have they been doing during
their five or ten years of service?”</p>

<p>“If they know so much, how many years would it take “Boob”
Sikes of Boobtown to learn as little as they appeared to know?”</p>

<p>By the time the questions begin to take on this sort of “How old
is Ann” character, you will have reached the conclusion that you have
discovered something and have seen things to prove it.</p>

<p>Just here it may be pertinently asked, why those top-notchers in
that postoffice should be blanketed by the stipulations of a civil
service law which gives them merit credits and grades for the years
they have been in the service? If you and I have been loafing on a
job for five, ten or more years&mdash;been foozling with the duties of that
job while heeling and fanning for a political party&mdash;why should the
law credit those years to us as service “experience?”</p>

<p>In placing any service or a division of any service under a merit
classification, the law should require that every position in such
service be filled by examination, and such examination should be open
alike to the shirt-sleeved employe already holding a position in such
service and to outsiders. Such a requirement would show what of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
service value there really was as a result of the years an employe had
been in the service.</p>

<p>Do you ever go to Washington, D. C.? If so, the next time you
go, take in one or more of the main divisions of the Postoffice Department.
Some guide or clerk will probably be detailed to steer you
through. Your pilot will talk considerable and his talk will listen
well. You need not, however, hear all nor even much of what he
says. As advised in your visit to the Presidential postoffice, keep
both your ears and your eyes open to hear and see what the service
employes say and do.</p>

<p>You will observe that a considerable number of the clerical force
are doing something&mdash;are really trying to work. You will also
discover before going far that a number of employes are industriously
engaged in talking. The smiles and quiet laughter which embellish
their conversation may lead you to believe that they are talking about
some of the humorous incidents and features of the postal service.
Do not, however, be hasty in arriving at such conclusion. If you get
near enough to hear an occasional word, you may discover that their
conversation is evidently about something which a humoresque
writer has described as “the recently distant elsewhere,” and not
about the department service at all. It may be about some feature
or phase of Washington’s social flux or about some social function
which is to stake a temporary claim in the circle in which the talkers
circulate. In short, you will discover that the conversation is but
commercially pasteurized small-talk and not business.</p>

<p>Moving on, you will observe other little groups in animated
conversation. A glance at the anæmic appearance of some of the
talkers will lead you to the immediate and sound conclusion that the
subject of conversation cannot be weighty. Politics, even party
politics, either practical or progressive, you will readily see would be
some sizes too large for them. Getting within hearing range, you will
learn that these industrious servants of the people are discussing
the telling points in some prize fight “pulled off” the night before or of
the ball game which some one or more of the coterie had seen the day
before. Maybe some one of the group is turning loose his stem-winding,
automatic bloviate ejector in telling his interested auditors about
what a “ripping time” he had with Rose at some dance or other
party last night. What you hear will be sufficient to convince you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that these “classified civil service employes” must put in considerable
time in mental and physical exertion to work out of their systems
the lessons they were taught at mother’s knee, and much more of their
time trying to keep several laps behind their jobs. You will also see
that some of the service men are workers&mdash;real <i>workers</i>&mdash;who earn
more than the salaries paid them. So, too, are there many of them
whose industry should make a more or less conspicuous service
trench into four or five dollars a day. But when you get outside or
get home, you will remember having seen numerous supervising and
directing heads and many clerks who appeared to be actually tiring
themselves out in exertions to keep away from work.</p>

<p>Yes, I repeat, the Postoffice Department carries upon its payrolls
too many non-producers of service values&mdash;too many mere
payroll-raiders on the postal revenues. Putting all these into graded
classified service and under the protection of a “joker”-ridden law
will not improve the actual service&mdash;will not stop the raid of which I
have been writing.</p>

<p>The civil service of the government and subordinate division of
it&mdash;city, county and state&mdash;should be controlled by law, not by political
partisanship. Mr. Hitchcock is forcefully right in what he says
on this very important subject. But laws providing rules and
regulations for the betterment of a public service should not provide
blind alleys and trenches through which dominating party officials
and “bosses” may so easily obstruct or balk accomplishment of the
purpose, or the alleged purpose, of the law. I have mentioned three
objectionable features common to nearly all civil service laws&mdash;to all
that I have read. There are other objectionable provisions in some
of the laws. I am not, however, intending to discuss here the desirability
or the objections to civil service, either as it is or as it should be,
save in so far as the present federal law has applied, is applied and
may be applied, to the postal service.</p>

<p>I have tried to show how three of its joker provisions&mdash;only <i>three</i>
of them, mind you&mdash;have worked, have been and may be “worked,”
to keep party henchmen on the jobs rather than to secure to the
people industrious, capable and efficient servants. Of the three wire-tapping
provisions of the law mentioned, I have suggested how two
of them might, in my opinion at least, be remedied. The third is that
of leaving it an easy possibility to victimize employes through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
agencies of partisan commissions selected to enforce or administer
the law and of incompetent, biased and prejudiced persons such
commissions may select to conduct examinations for entrance or
promotions in the service. How remedy that?</p>

<p>Having civil service commissioners <i>elected</i>, instead of being
selected by a temporary official over-lord would, in my judgment, go
far toward correcting the abuses which now flourish so luxuriously
under that third “joker” provision of the law.</p>

<p>Any service embracing a considerable number of persons in its
execution, must be closely supervised if anything approaching
efficiency is attained and maintained. An old German saying reads
thus: “The eye of a master will do more work than both his hands.”
If value is secured either in public or in private service, the people
paid for delivering it must be kept under close supervision&mdash;must be
kept under “the eye of the master.” A consciousness of having
earned his pay should enable any service man, whatever his position,
to shake hands with himself without blushing at the close of his day’s
work. But if his superiors set him an example in loafing, of hitting
the nail slack while on duty, most men will soon learn not only how
to loaf but how to accept any amount of pay for services not rendered,
and accept it, too, without a flicker of blush or jar of conscientious
scruple.</p>

<p>So in closing our consideration of this phase of our subject, permit
me to say that efficient civil service will never be attained&mdash;can
never be attained&mdash;if department, division and other supervising
and directing heads sit at their desks most of the time, approving
documents and requisitions, reading reports and talking politics.
If they expect men under them to work, they must get out on the job
where they expect the work to be done, and that, too, whether the
job be in the office or in the field.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">PARCELS POST RAIDERS.</span></h2>

<p>Anyone who attempts to give our parcels post service anything
like careful, studious consideration will, at the very outset of such
consideration, find himself confronted by a number of bald facts
which, when fully rounded out and understood, should make unnecessary
any discussion of our claim that we need, should have and are entitled
to better and cheaper service than that we now have. Without
attempting any immediate discussion of these facts, I desire to
present them, or some of them, to the reader’s consideration just
here at the opening of our discussion of the subject. The desire to
do this is prompted by a hope that their presentation here will
induce the reader to think of their significance and their bearing upon
the parcels post question in any fair discussion of it.</p>

<p>Now for these facts:</p>

<p>1. There are about 250,000 miles of railroad in this country&mdash;more
than the aggregate mileage of all the other nations of earth.</p>

<p>2. The capitalization of the railroads of these United States is
now, according to Poor’s Manual of Railroads, the universally recognized
authority, about $18,800,000,000&mdash;<i>Eighteen billion eight
hundred million dollars</i>!</p>

<p>3. That capitalization is admittedly <i>twice</i> the value of all the
tangible values&mdash;trackage, rolling stock, terminals, shops and other&mdash;owned
by the roads. In many instances the capitalization of a road
is easily three times the value of its tangible property.</p>

<p>4. Most of these railroads were built with borrowed money,
covered by bond issues, and the payment of the bonds met from the
<i>earnings of the roads</i>, or by new issues of bonds, payment of which
has been, or it is intended will be, met from earnings. In view of
this method of financing construction and equipment, it is well
known in informed circles that the present capitalization of these
railroads is <i>ten or twelve</i> times the actual cash ever invested in them&mdash;that
is, cash other than that collected from the people for freight,
passenger, and other service rendered&mdash;rendered at rates <i>unscrupulously</i>
excessive. Some of the best informed people have gone so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
as to say that <i>all</i> of the stock and a considerable part of the bond
capitalization of the nation’s railroads <i>is water</i>.</p>

<p>5. There are a number of express companies in this country.
The express business of the country, however, is controlled by six
companies&mdash;the “Big Six.”</p>

<p>6. The express transportation (land) is wholly by railroads.
The railroad companies, and men owning large or controlling interest
in railroads, own a large majority of the “Big Six” stock capitalization.</p>

<p>7. For most of the express company stock owned by railroads,
no cash consideration whatsoever was given. For the stock, a railroad
company gave to some express company a monopoly of the
express business on its line or system of lines of road.</p>

<p>8. The express companies, in addition to any stock bonus they
may have given for the monopoly of the express business on a rail
line or system of lines, pay to the railroads on which they operate
<i>forty to fifty-eight per cent of the gross receipts</i> from the express business
handled.</p>

<p>9. The railroads furnish cars free to the express companies.
They also furnish depot accommodations and facilities for storing
and handling express shipments. In some instances, as much as 90
per cent of the handling of express shipping is done by railroad
employes.</p>

<p>10. There are thirty-seven directors in the controlling express
companies. Of these, thirty-two are also directors in some one or
more railroad companies or are large owners of railroad stocks and
bonds.</p>

<p>11. Practically no cash investment whatsoever was ever made
in establishing or organizing an express company, nor in equipment
to conduct its business. Every dollar of value there is in equipment
and other tangible assets of the express companies today&mdash;and
<i>hundreds of millions besides</i>&mdash;has come from the people&mdash;has been
<i>taken</i> from the people for handling their express business at rates
ranging from <i>two to five times the actual cost of handling</i>.</p>

<p>12. The controlling express companies&mdash;“associations” some
of them are called&mdash;pay 8 to 12 per cent dividends yearly on their
stock capitalization, which stock has but a fraction of substantial
values back of it, and <i>all</i> those real values have come from earnings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
13. In addition to the regular annual dividends paid, these
express companies, every few years, “cut a melon”&mdash;pay stockholders
a substantial “extra” dividend. One company (Wells,
Fargo &amp; Co.), with a stock capital of $5,000,000 in 1872&mdash;and no one
knowing what tangible assets that five millions represented&mdash;increased
it to $8,000,000 in 1893. That added $3,000,000 was issued to the
Union Pacific Railroad for a contract which gave the express company
a monopoly of the express business on the Union Pacific rail system.
On that eight millions the express company paid annual dividends
ranging from 6 to 9 per cent from 1893 to 1901. From 1902 to 1907
it paid 9 per cent annually, since which date its annual dividend rate
has been 10 per cent.</p>

<p>In addition to these substantial yearly dividends on $8,000,000
of stock, <i>which cost its holders little or nothing</i>, this company cut a
huge “melon” in 1910. This melon was an extra dividend to its
stockholders of 100 per cent in cash ($8,000,000) and a stock dividend
of 200 per cent&mdash;<i>a total of 300 per cent as an extra dividend</i>&mdash;thus
raising its stock capitalization from $8,000,000 to $24,000,000.</p>

<p>On this twenty-four millions of stock the company has continued
to pay 10 per cent annually.</p>

<p><i>The net earnings of the company for 1910 and 1911 were about
20 per cent on its $24,000,000 of stock.</i></p>

<p>14. There are no express companies in European countries.
The heavier express shipments here are there handled&mdash;and satisfactorily
handled&mdash;by the railroads direct. All the lighter express
shipments are there handled by the parcels post.</p>

<p>15. The parcels post service of European countries is entirely
satisfactory to the people, is cheaper than the pretense of a parcels
post service which has victimized the people of this country for a half-century
and <i>far</i> cheaper than the rates we have been forced to pay for
express service.</p>

<p>16. As it was originally designed, and <i>so provided by law</i>, that
our government should have a monopoly in the carriage and delivery
of packages and parcels, the express companies in this country&mdash;<i>all
of them</i>&mdash;have been and are engaged in an <i>outlawed traffic. They are
criminals.</i></p>

<p>17. Our government, in all its branches&mdash;legislative, executive
and judicial&mdash;has been party to this outlawry. It not only has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
protected these express and railway raiders while they robbed us, but
<i>it has permitted itself to be robbed by them</i>.</p>

<p>The seventeen statements of fact should be sufficient for a starter&mdash;a
starter for arriving at a safe, sound conclusion as to how and why
a comparatively few folks get fabulously rich so quickly and so easily
while so many <i>millions</i> of other folks, though lavish in industry and
self-denying in expenditure, rise only to modest means or remain
poor.</p>

<p>We shall now take up a discussion of the parcels post&mdash;as it has
served us, and as it has served other peoples and should be made to
serve us.</p>

<p>The first thing that is noticed in taking a ladder-top view of this
Parcels post question is the <i>immense</i> amount of public bubbling talk
and writing and <i>money</i> that is being expended upon, about and around
it.</p>

<p>Is it the people? No. That is easily to be seen. The people
are being written and talked to. The people are saying little, write
less and are not <i>putting up the money to bubble themselves</i> in the <i>anti</i>-parcels
post campaign.</p>

<p>Is the general government putting up the oil and fuel to run this
anti-parcels post bunk-shooting game?</p>

<p>Well, the government for years has made little noticeable effort
to give the people better and cheaper parcels accommodation in its
mail service. That is, the <i>executive</i> arm of the national government
has done so. The legislative arm of the national government has
<i>uniformly</i>, though never unanimously, <i>opposed</i> any and every measure
intended to increase the <i>service</i> value of parcel mail-carriage to
the people.</p>

<p>“Why have U. S. congressmen and senators opposed?”</p>

<p><i>They have opposed, because the party caucuses of the House and
the Senate have been and are dominated and controlled by men who were
and are opposed to such legislation.</i></p>

<p>Still, the government, executive or legislative, has probably
spent no money and has certainly made little noise to defeat the
establishment of a better and cheaper parcels post service.</p>

<p>Now, if it is not the people themselves nor the people’s government
who are making all the parcels post noise, <i>buying</i> newspaper
space and putting up money to <i>steer country merchants and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
into organizing and petitioning against increased parcel facilities in the
mails</i>&mdash;if it is not the people trying to bubble themselves nor the
government trying to bubble the people, I wonder who it is? Who
is putting up for the <i>fuel and oil</i> to run this anti-parcels post
<i>opinion-molding</i> sulky-rake, which has been so vigorously, so industriously
and so <i>designedly</i> dragged over the mental hay-fields of
the American <i>hoi polloi</i> during recent years? What’s the answer?</p>

<p>Unless, of course, one has taken on an over-load of this anti-parcels
post tonnage, thereby giving his <i>feelings</i> a chance to hip-lock
or strangle-hold his intelligence, he’ll not need to browse around long
for an answer.</p>

<p>You have a boy working at Blue Island or Elgin, Illinois. Mother
in Chicago wants to send him a Christmas present. If it weighs no
more than four pounds she can send it by mail, paying <i>one cent an
ounce</i>. If she wants to feel sure that her boy gets it, she can “register”
the parcel, <i>paying ten cents more</i>.</p>

<p>If the parcel weighs <i>the fraction of an ounce more</i> than four pounds,
mother <i>cannot send it to her boy through the mail service at all</i>. If the
parcel weighs exactly four pounds, then our Uncle Samuel will
deliver it at Blue Island or at Elgin when mother puts up <i>sixty-four
cents</i>&mdash;seventy-four, if mother wants to feel sure that her boy gets it
and for that reason has the parcel “registered.”</p>

<p>That is one case&mdash;one <i>statement of fact</i>.</p>

<p>Andrew Carnegie at Skibo Castle, Scotland, desires to send a
four-pound Christmas present to some son of Norval or “blow-hole”
friend in Los Angeles, California, or Mrs. John Bull, at Manchester,
England, has a yearning&mdash;and the price&mdash;to send a present of corresponding
weight to her daughter Margaret, who is happily, likewise
<i>richly</i>, married and who lives in a beautiful suburb of San
Francisco. Well, “Andy” and Mrs. John Bull can send their four-pound
presents&mdash;to be more exact, <i>they</i> can send even if the parcels
weight up to <i>eleven</i> pounds each&mdash;can have those four-pound parcels
carried by rail to some steamship port, carried across the Atlantic
ocean, put into <i>our</i> mail cars, carried with <i>our own</i> mail across the
entire country and <i>delivered by American carriers</i> to the <i>remotest</i>
suburb of Los Angeles or San Francisco for <i>forty-eight cents&mdash;three-fourths</i>
the price mother has to pay to get <i>her four-pound</i> present to her
boy at Blue Island or Elgin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>That is another case&mdash;<i>another statement of fact</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>many years</i> the United States government has <i>carried</i> parcels
of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals, weighing up to 220
<i>pounds</i>, to any point in the country reached by its mail service, broke
the package and delivered each separate piece to individual addresses
in postoffice boxes or by carrier for <i>one cent a pound</i>.</p>

<p>Yet it persists in charging mother <i>sixteen cents</i> a pound to send
her present to her boy at Elgin or Blue Island and <i>compels</i> her to
keep its weight down to <i>four pounds</i>.</p>

<p>That is another case&mdash;<i>another statement of fact</i>.</p>

<p>For many years, the government has carried by mail, not hundreds,
but <i>thousands</i> of tons of parcels <i>free</i>. Every United States
Senator, every Congressman, every department head, every division
head, every first, second, third or fourth “assistant” department
or division head, every political “fence” builder, whatever his position
in the government’s official service, <i>uses his franking privilege</i>.</p>

<p>Not only that. <i>Most of them abuse it.</i></p>

<p>Not only that. Most of those who abuse it do not confine the
abuse to franking public documents to “friends at home” and
speeches&mdash;most of which were never made or were made or written by
somebody else&mdash;to “my constituents.” Oh, no! That government
“frank,” so it has been credibly asserted, has been used to carry
easy chairs, side boards, couches and other household goods which
have been “bought cheap”&mdash;<i>some of it too cheap to carry a price tag</i>&mdash;and
which “can be used at home.” Typewriters, filing cases,
office desks, frequently acquired by a process of <i>benevolent appropriation</i>,
have reached home <i>without carriage charge</i>.</p>

<p>That is another case&mdash;<i>another statement of fact</i>.</p>

<p>But why continue? I could go on for a page or two with
<i>statements of fact</i>, all evidencing this other <i>FACT</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mother&mdash;your mother, my mother&mdash;the great tax-paying body of
our people&mdash;is wronged, is victimized, by our postal service and regulations.</i></p>

<p>That is my opinion. That opinion is based upon a “broad,
general and <i>comprehensive</i> view”&mdash;a ladder-top view&mdash;“of the whole
question in its various and varying details,” as one <i>anti</i>-parcels post
spouter has spouted.</p>

<p>I have presented but <i>four</i> statements of fact. A score of others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
will readily appear to any reader who does his own thinking. But
take any one of the four above given and study its significance for
just <i>one minute</i>.</p>

<p>Have you done so? “Yes?” Well, then you see the joke&mdash;or
the “joker”&mdash;in the <i>anti</i>-parcels post talk and literature, do you not?
You will also be able to make a close guess as to <i>who are financially
backing</i> the public-bubbling <i>opposition</i> to any legislation for the
improvement of our parcels post service. If you cannot, I advise
you to go to some jokesmith and have the gaskets and packings on
your think-tank tightened up.</p>

<p>John Wanamaker was a great merchant. He was a brainy
business man and, to a large extent, did his <i>own thinking</i>. He was,
for a term of years, Postmaster General of the United States. Mr.
Wanamaker was likewise a man of broad, comprehensive and <i>comprehending</i>
humor. He could crack or take a joke. In either event, the
kernel was separated from the shell quickly. Here is one of Mr.
Wanamaker’s jokes:</p>

<p>Years ago, when Mr. Wanamaker was Postmaster General, John
Brisbane Walker asked him why the American people stood for the
existing parcels post outrage. Mr. Walker believed the American
people were quick, <i>judgmental</i> thinkers and <i>swift</i> in remedial action
when thought reached the conclusion that the <i>thinker was being
victimized</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker was right&mdash;<i>is</i> right. American people do think.
The trouble is that too many of us are <i>coupled into train with the
wrong kind of thinkers</i>. We are switched or shunted onto any side-track
or yarding the engineer, the conductor or the <i>traffic manager</i>
desires. We simply <i>think</i> we think, while really we are merely
following a <i>steer</i>. But I digress.</p>

<p>To Mr. Walker’s question, Mr. Wanamaker made this reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is true that parcels could be carried at about <i>one-twelfth</i> their present
cost by the Postoffice Department, but you do not seem to be aware that there are
four <i>insuperable obstacles</i> to carrying parcels by the United States Postoffice
Department. The first of these is the <i>Adams Express Company</i>; the second is the
<i>American Express Company</i>; the third is the <i>Wells-Fargo Express Company</i>;
and the fourth, the <i>Southern Express Company</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course there are several more “insuperable obstacles” to an
improvement in our parcels post service. There is the previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
mentioned “big six” obstacles with the railroads, now as when Mr.
Wanamaker spoke, <i>owning or controlling them all</i>.</p>

<p>The reader may <i>know</i>&mdash;no need of <i>guessing</i>&mdash;that those insuperable
obstacles are <i>stoking</i> the engines which are “yarding” public
opinion&mdash;and much honest, but superficial or careless, <i>private opinion</i>&mdash;where
it will yield <i>unearned</i> revenues to the stokers. Any man who
argues <i>against</i> cheapening our parcels post rates is merely a <i>hired</i>
angler for suckers or a sharer in the spoils which railroad and express
raiders are looting from the people.</p>

<p>I recently heard one of those patriotic hired “cappers” talk to
his job. Among his forceful points were the following:</p>

<p>“The big express companies employ nearly 100,000 men.</p>

<p>“Their payroll (officials included), is nearly $50,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>“Roosevelt added 99,000 names to the federal pay roll during his
seven years in office.</p>

<p>“There are about 70,000 postoffices in the United States and an
improved parcels post service would require an additional clerk in
each. Therefore 70,000 more tax-eaters would be added to the federal
payrolls.</p>

<p>“There was a <i>deficit</i> of $6,000,000 piled up in the Postoffice Department
last year. To what <i>appalling</i> figures would that deficit
mount if a parcels post were established?”</p>

<p>Now, I want to ask a few questions.</p>

<p>First, those 100,000 men employed by the big express companies
and who are paid the colossal sum of $50,000,000 in salaries. The
express companies neither employ so many men nor pay so much
money. But if they did, that is an <i>average</i> of but $500 a year to each
employe. Do you think those 100,000 express men would lose any
<i>killing</i> amount in annual salary if the government took the whole
bunch of them bodily over and put them into a parcels post service?</p>

<p>So much for those alleged 100,000 express company <i>employes</i>,
concerning whose interests and welfare the <i>anti</i>-parcel post bunk-shooter
<i>appears</i> to have had a pain in his lap or bunions on his mind.</p>

<p>Now, how about the 90,000,000 or more people who make up the
rest of us folks in these United States? How would we come out in
the ledger account if a good, efficient and <i>cheap</i> parcels post service
was put into operation and the “big express companies” put out of
business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite impossible to figure it out to the cent. The <i>public</i>
reports of those big express companies, likewise their system of double
cross bookkeeping, prevent us getting nearer than about eight blocks
of their “inside information.” But some of the <i>governing facts</i> we
know and others must <i>necessarily</i> follow in <i>any</i> process or method of
reasoning recognized outside the harmless ward of a crazy house.</p>

<p>The stock of express companies is <i>owned</i> largely by a comparatively
few people&mdash;a thousand, possibly five hundred, persons own
90 per cent of this stock. No one at all familiar with express company
tangibles, unless he is exercising a loose-screwed veracity, will estimate
their <i>aggregate</i> tangible values <i>above</i> twenty or twenty-five
millions. More than that. The present tangible values in these
companies <i>are</i>, as previously stated, almost wholly <i>investments from
earnings</i>. So largely, in fact, is that true that <i>six million dollars</i>
is a <i>liberal</i> estimate for the <i>actual cash capital</i> at any time invested
in actual operation.</p>

<p>These companies paid their owners two to three and a half,
or more, millions a year <i>in dividends</i>.</p>

<p>Since 1907, the Adams company has paid $480,000 a year on
$12,000,000 of bonds. Those twelve million of 4 per cent bonds were
<i>given to the stockholders. Not one cent of actual cash was given in
consideration.</i></p>

<p>What has that to do with the parcels post question? Simply
this:</p>

<p>When the government installs a parcels post service that accepts,
carries and <i>delivers</i> packages weighing from twelve to twenty or more
pounds these <i>looting express and railroad raiders will go out of business</i>.</p>

<h3>SUBSIDY RAIDERS.</h3>

<p>Everybody who has studied the question at all knows that all
alleged deficits in the postal service are the malformed progeny of an
illegal union between crooked public officials and criminal violators
of the law enacted to establish and govern the carriage and
delivery of mail matter in these United States. So noticeable has
been the closed eyes and “rear view” of government officials while the
railroad and express raiders raided and walked off with their loot
that petty thieves began to shin up the posts of the Postoffice
Department directly or sneak in by way of Congressional legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“What were they after?” Why, they wanted a “subsidy” for
carrying foreign or ocean mails, or they wanted a “pork” contract&mdash;one
of those contracts which renders little service for much money.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of Tahiti? No. It is <i>not</i> a breakfast food nor
a sure cure for cancers. It is an island. “Where?” Ask the
Almighty. I don’t know, and I am doubtful whether the Almighty
knows or <i>cares</i>. I know it is an island somewhere, because a few
years ago the postal department entered into a contract with some
“tramp” steamer flying a <i>rag</i>, which <i>close</i> inspection might discover
had <i>once</i> been the American flag.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department paid that tramp $45,000 for carrying
our mails to Tahiti&mdash;<i>a service that another vessel in the Tahiti trade
offered to render for $3,500</i>.</p>

<p>Can there be any <i>legitimate</i> surprise or wonder at a “deficit”
resulting from such business methods?</p>

<p>But that, of course, was “a few years ago.” Yet, stay! On
page 264 of the 1910 report of the Postoffice Department, I find that
the Oceanic Line&mdash;a line of United States register&mdash;carried to and from
Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands 7,622 pounds of letters and 159,483
pounds of prints. This was carried under a “contract” and the
Oceanic people were paid $46,398 for the service&mdash;<i>for carrying about
88 tons of mail matter</i>.</p>

<p>Looks like a good “deficit” producer, does it not?</p>

<p>But there is another queer thing about this Tahiti mail contract.
Note (1) on page 263, to which the report refers readers, says steamers
of United States register <i>not under contract</i> are paid 80 cents a pound
for carrying letters and 8 cents a pound for carrying prints. Figuring
up the Oceanic’s service at those rates gives as result only $18,856.24.</p>

<p>So it can readily be seen there is something in a “contract”&mdash;some
contracts, anyway.</p>

<p>On the same page (264), I find that another ship, one of the
Union Line and under foreign register, touches at Tahiti in making
New Zealand. It carried 2,713,850 grams (about 5,970 pounds) of
letters and 58,926,887 grams (about 129,639 pounds) of prints&mdash;within
16 tons the weight the Oceanic people carried&mdash;and received only
$7,781.54 for the service. These vessels of foreign register are paid
about 35 cents a pound for letter weights and 4½ cents for print weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Figuring up the weights hurriedly at the named rates, I find
that the Union folks were entitled to $7,923.40, or some $142 <i>more</i>
than was paid them. The Oceanic folks, you will remember, were
paid $46,398 when at <i>open</i> carriage rates of pay to vessels of
United States register they earned only $18,856.24.</p>

<p>Looks a little off color, does it not? But we must remember
that Tahiti is an island. Must be an island of vast importance. It
requires the shipment of 88 tons of mail matter in a year&mdash;a whole
year&mdash;and our government pays $46,398 haulage on it. Something
over 79 of those 88 tons of mail was printed weight, too.</p>

<p>What great printers and publishers those Tahitians and Marquesans
must be! Or was that print stuff of United States origin?
Catalogues and franked and penalty matter, I wonder?</p>

<p>At any rate there is the “contract” in 1910 as an evidence that
some one here is doing, or has done, a little turn toward “burning”
postal revenues and helping, in a small way, to keep a postal “deficit”
in evidence. A deficit, you know, shows that the revenues of the
department are too low, too small, to permit the establishment of an
efficient, cheap parcels post, or so the railroad and express raiders
would have us think.</p>

<p>The important point, however, is: Are we fools enough to
think it? If so, how long shall we continue to be fools enough to
think it? If not, is it not about time that we created a disturbance&mdash;that
we raise some dust&mdash;in efforts to let these raiders and their
cappers know we are not fools? Why should we continue to act
foolish if we are not fools? Please rise, Mr. Sensible Citizen, and
answer.</p>

<p>As before said, no one expects nor desires the government to
<i>make money</i> out of <i>their</i> mail service. People have, however, <i>a right</i>
to expect&mdash;<i>and to demand</i>&mdash;that their regularly chosen representatives
and other government officials <i>prevent</i> a lot of raiders, or any
one else for that matter, from making more than a <i>fair, legitimate
profit</i> on what they do for or contribute to that service.</p>

<p>There has been much talk the last three or four years about the
economies effected by the Postoffice Department in the execution of
the work it was established to do. How much of this talk is grounded
on fact and how much of it is mere political gargle and party and
administration “fan”-talk I shall not here attempt to say. Time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
not permitted me to look into these averred economies carefully and
thoroughly enough to warrant positive statements from me anent
them here. I am inclined to believe, however, that the present
Postmaster General, Mr. Hitchcock, and his immediate predecessors,
Mr. Meyer and Mr. Cortelyou, have really accomplished a little in
the right direction&mdash;a little, where the Lord knows we <i>should</i> know
there was much to accomplish. But, as stated, my favorable opinion
is not based on what I have dug up myself about these economies
alleged to have been effected in the recently passed years. If they
have been effected, their accomplishment only goes to prove that
advocates of a cheap parcels post in this country have been
<i>right</i> in their facts and arguments, and also that their exposures and
severe condemnation of the waste, extravagance, grafting and
<i>stealing</i> in the postal service were timely and well deserved.</p>

<p>Something, however, has, I think, been done. The exposure of
criminal crookedness, grafting, waste and thievery which existed in
the department&mdash;with administrative employes, officers, Congressmen
and Senators, either directly or collusively connected with it&mdash;was
bound to wipe some leaking joints in the service. The exposures
uncovered so much porch-climbing and so much nastiness that most
decent citizens were holding their noses and thinking of buying a
gun. Something <i>had</i> to be done. The noise and injured-innocence
“holler,” which railroad and express company raiders are vocalizing
and printing, is pretty good evidence not only that some little has
been done to them, but also that they fear more is going to be done
to jam the gear or otherwise interfere with the smooth running of
some one or more of their high-speed, noiseless-action cream separators.
And more will be done if the people keep on the mat and keep
swinging for the jaw and plexus. But it is not all done yet. The
raiders may be squealing and squirming a little. They always do
when a little hurt. But they are still busy&mdash;still actively after the
cream. They may spar a little for time, but they will use the time
actively in figuring out a new entrance into the people’s milk house.</p>

<p>And these raiders will find a way to get in, too, if the people pull
up the blankets and let themselves be talked and foozled to sleep.</p>

<h3>TOUTING FOR “FAST MAIL.”</h3>

<p>There appears to be much talk about “fast mail” service. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
course if the railways are already running at a destructive loss on mail
weight and space-rental pay&mdash;which they are not&mdash;why they will
want more pay if they furnish a fast mail service. The postal authorities
(official) seem to think that a “fast mail” is a thing altogether
lovely and much to be desired. The railroad carriers are of
like mind, but&mdash;well, such service costs more money. They want
more money. A fast mail is just the thing the people want and need!
It will push the corn crop ahead and keep the frost off the peaches!</p>

<p>For these and other equally <i>easy</i> reasons it is sought to steer the
people into making a scream for a “fast mail” service. They want
and need their mail in a hurry. The quicker the better. In fact,
from the way some people are already talking, it would appear they
want their mail delivered about twenty-four hours before it starts
in their direction.</p>

<p>If the cream-skimming raiders and their “public servant”
assistants can only get the people to talking for a “fast mail” service,
why a fast mail we will have, and we will <i>pay the raiders for furnishing
it</i>.</p>

<p>How will we pay them?</p>

<p>Oh, that is easy. Bonuses and subsidies are popular fashions
in federal legislative society. Likewise they appear to be popular in
postoffice circles. They are seasonable the year around and are cut
to fit any figure. They don’t stand the wash very well, but&mdash;well,
don’t wash them. The raiders and their official valets always keep
them brushed up and vacuum cleaned. Just pay for them is all
the people have to do.</p>

<p>I recall a serviceable subsidized fast mail gown which was
handed to a railroad between Kansas City, Mo., and Newton, Kan.,
some years since. It was neatly boxed and delivered by the handlers
of postoffice appropriations. It was worth $25,000 a year to the road
that got it.</p>

<p>“Of what use was it to the people?”</p>

<p>None whatever. The fast train it was made to drape was put
on the line named for the sole service and benefit of two Kansas City
newspapers. It swished those papers (their midnight editions), into
Western Kansas, Oklahoma and Northern Texas ahead of the appearance
of local morning issues.</p>

<p>I recall another “fast mail” bonus. It was $190,000 and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to the Southern Railway for a fast train out of New York for New
Orleans. It left New York about 4 a. m. and <i>carried little or no mail
for delivery north of Charlotte, N. C.</i></p>

<p>It arrived in New Orleans, if I remember rightly, along about 2 a.
m. the next day&mdash;<i>too late for delivery of any mail before the opening
of the day’s business</i>&mdash;9 or 10 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>But the regular mail train, as was shown in the debate in the
Senate, left New York at about 2. a. m. and arrived in New Orleans
about 4:30 a. m.&mdash;two hours after the so-called “fast mail”&mdash;in
ample time for deliveries when the business of the city opened.</p>

<p>Fine business that, is it not? Well, yes, for the <i>Southern Railway</i>.</p>

<p>The reader, however, should be able to recognize it as a regular
60 H. P., six-cylinder, rubber-tired “<i>deficit</i>” producer. Especially will
he so recognize it if he thinks of it in connection with this other
fact:</p>

<p>That same year, the Southern Railway was paid, in addition to
the $190,000 “fast mail” subsidy mentioned, <i>over one million dollars
at the regular weight rates for hauling the mails</i>!</p>

<p>There are numerous others of equal beauty and effectiveness in
design. As previously stated, however, subsidies and bonuses are
all carefully designed and cut to fit any figure. All we wise, “easy”
people need do is to make a little noise for a “fast mail” service and
Congress will hand it out.</p>

<p>The railroad raiders can easily justify their demands for subsidies
for a fast mail service with people who have given little or no study to
this mail-carrying question. Our Postoffice Department furnishes
the raiders about all the argument that is needed. One of the raiders
has been quoted as saying: “We could carry the mails at one-half
cent per ton mile, if the Postoffice Department would allow us to
handle it in our own way.”</p>

<p>There you are. The department will not let these raiders help
the people <i>save their own money</i>. Very generous. Much like a
burglar calling on you the day before in order to tell you how to
prevent him from cracking your safe.</p>

<p>But the beauty of that railroader’s statement lies in the fact that
it states a fact; not one of these glittering, rhetorical facts, but a
real <i>de facto fact</i>.</p>

<p>The rules and regulations of the Postoffice Department for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
carriage of mails in postoffice cars are such as furnish ample grounds
and warrant for the railway official’s statement.</p>

<p>Postoffice cars are from 40 to 50 or more feet in length and weigh,
empty, from 50,000 to 110,000 pounds. The department then has
fixtures and handling equipment put in. This equipment occupies
about two-thirds of the floor space of the car, and, with the four to
twelve railway mail clerks also put into it, weighs from 10 to 15 or
more tons. The railroad is paid for carrying all this bulky, space-occupying
equipment at the regular mail-weight pay rates.</p>

<p>And how much real mail does the department get into these
postoffice cars?</p>

<p>Well, some years since Professor Adams, after a most careful
and extended investigation, placed the average weight of mail
actually carried at two tons. He pointed out, however, that the mail
load could easily go to three and a half tons and referred to the
Pennsylvania road which, in its special mail trains, loaded as high as
six tons. He also stated that if the load were increased to five tons,
the cost of carriage would be <i>reduced more than one-half</i>, and he made
it very clear that his figures were easily inside the service possibilities.</p>

<p>In view of such evidence and testimony from Professor Adams,
and of other men to much the same effect, the department may possibly
have increased the mail load since 1907 to three or maybe to
three and a half tons.</p>

<p>Even so, it is still evident that the railroad must haul from
70,000 to 140,000 pounds of car and equipment to carry 6,000 to
7,000 pounds of mail; thirty-five to seventy tons of dead load to carry
three to three and a half tons of live&mdash;of service&mdash;load. Do not
forget that, so far as the railroads pay is concerned, the equipment
is live weight&mdash;<i>paid weight</i>. So, the railroads get paid for a load
of fifteen to eighteen and a half tons, while they carry only three to
three and a half tons of mail&mdash;for carrying, according to Professor
Adams’s figures in 1907, only two tons of mail.</p>

<p>As a deficit-producer that should rank high. As an evidence
that our Postoffice Department is run on economic lines, that mail
car tonnage load is nearly conclusive enough to convince the residents
of almost any harmless ward.</p>

<p>Speaking seriously, the department’s methods of mail-loading
the postoffice car&mdash;methods which put from two to three and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
tons into cars that should carry six to ten tons&mdash;furnishes the carriage-raiders
an excellent basis for their talks to the people to the
effect that the roads are not getting sufficient pay for carrying the
mails now, and if they (the people) want better or faster service the
roads must be paid more money, either as bonuses or subsidies. In
fact, the railroad people have been holding up this nonsensical&mdash;or
collusive&mdash;practice of the department for years as basis for their
demands for more pay for hauling the government mails. As proof
of this statement, take the testimony of Mr. Julius Kruttschnitt
before the Wolcott Commission, I think it was. Mr. Kruttschnitt was
then (1901) Fourth Vice-President of the Southern Pacific. In
reply to the Commission’s inquiry as to whether or not the mails could
be profitably carried over the New Orleans-San Francisco routes at a
half cent a pound ($10.00 per ton or for $100 to $200 per car if
reasonably loaded), Mr. Kruttschnitt is reported to have answered in
part that “at half a cent a pound the mileage rate for 442 miles is
2.3 cents. Statement G,” he continued, “shows that to carry one ton
of mail we carry nineteen tons of <i>dead weight</i>, so that for hauling
twenty tons we get 2 cents or a little over one-tenth of a cent a gross
ton mile.”</p>

<p>All very forceful and conclusive, if it were true, which it is not.
It is true, however, that Mr. Kruttschnitt was making good argumentative
use of the ridiculously low loading of cars under the regulations
of the department. That is all. If the postoffice car used on
Mr. Kruttschnitt’s road was a 50-foot car and weighed, say, 100,000
pounds, that and the railway mail clerks constituted the only “dead”
weight hauled.</p>

<p>His road got paid for hauling the tons of ridiculously heavy
mail-handling equipment and fixtures in that car&mdash;got paid for
hauling them <i>both ways</i>, at the regular mail-weight rates. His road
also received over $8,000 a year rental, or “space pay,” whichever
the rail-raiders desire to call it, for the use of that car for mail haulage.</p>

<p>So, it is really not so bad as Mr. Kruttschnitt apparently would
have it appear. In fact, one does not have to look into the matter
very closely to see that the Southern Pacific had what might be
called a “good thing” in its mail carrying contract.</p>

<p>But what are the railroads really paid for hauling mail tonnage
as compared with the rates they receive for hauling other tonnage?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>In writing to this phase of the question at the time of the
pendency of the Fitzgerald and another bill,&mdash;the former requiring
that periodical publishers pay $160 and the latter that they pay $80
per ton for mail carriage of their publication&mdash;Mr. Atkinson said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Let it not be forgotten, that publishers pay the government $20 per ton for
their papers; doesn’t it seem enough, when the government is so generous toward
the railroads that it pays for transporting 1,000 pounds of leather, locks, etc., for
every 100 pounds of letters?</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>It is no unusual thing for the railroads to haul live hogs from Chicago to
Philadelphia, a very inconvenient as well as unpleasant kind of freight. The hogs
have to be fed and watered on the way, they cannot be stacked one upon another,
so require much space. What do the railroads charge for this service? Is it
$160 per ton? No. Is it $80 per ton? No. Is it $20 per ton? No. They
do it for $6 per ton, and are glad of the job.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Parsons wrote a volume a few years ago entitled
“The Railways, The Trusts and The People.” Professor Parsons
looked into this ton-mile rate of pay for rail haulage most carefully
and gave the results of his investigations in his book, from which I
take the tabulated rates following.</p>

<p>In passing, I may say that the professor is recognized by everybody
as a most dependable authority&mdash;that is, everybody save the
railroad and express raiders and their hired men. They have written
and talked at great length to “refute” him, which thoughtful and
disinterested people take as mighty strong evidence that Professor
Parsons presented the truth and the facts, or so nearly the truth and
facts that his statements made the “authorized,” rake-off patriots
turn loose on him their high-powered, chain-tired public bubblers.</p>

<p>Following are the figures which the Professor published as
showing the average <i>ton mile</i> rates the railroads then received for
carrying different kinds of shipments:</p>

<h3>THE PARCELS POST.</h3>

<p>The Postmaster General in his reports for 1908-9 and 1909-10
recommends a trial or “test” of a parcels post service on several rural
routes “to be selected by the Postmaster General.”</p>

<p>The Congress now in session is giving, or will give, this recommendation
serious consideration, it is presumed. Especially will it
be given such serious consideration when the 1911-12 bill, making
appropriations for the postal service, is under fire and is being “savagely
attached by its friends.”</p>

<p>It may be depended upon that the express and railroad gentlemen
now shearing a rich fleece from your Uncle’s postal fold will not have
any <i>fair</i> tests made of a parcels post service so long as they can
prevent it, and they appear to have numerous representatives in
both houses of Congress who can be influenced to prevent it, if their
past talk and <i>votes</i> may be taken as indicating <i>what they are
there for</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, the chief clack of the enemy’s hired men is “lack of
funds.” Yet they go on appropriating <i>millions to people who do not
earn it</i>&mdash;to pay for services <i>not rendered</i>.</p>

<p>The same kippered tongue lashed the “rural delivery” service
the <i>same</i> way. In the end, the people won. But they won, in the
bill as originally passed, a rural delivery of the “test” variety.
“Why?” Well, a properly equipped and serviceable rural delivery
would be a step towards a serviceable parcels post and the raiders do
not want the people to have such a parcels post.</p>

<p>As samples of the <i>sort</i> of “friendly feeling” manifest in Congress
toward a parcels post and of the <i>profound</i> wisdom carried by some
of its alleged friends, I desire to make a quotation or two.</p>

<p>When the measure was first up (1908), Representative Lever
of South Carolina introduced the four counties “experimental test”
amendment in the House. Following is his opening:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every <i>farmer here present</i> knows of his <i>own experience</i> how much time is
taken in <i>extra</i> trips to town and city.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, that is <i>real</i> fetching. Especially before so vast a gathering
<i>of farmers</i> as heard it!</p>

<p>But a Missouri “farmer” present wanted to be shown. So he
fired a question at Mr. Lever. The farmer from Missouri wears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
name of Caulfield. He likewise wears an abiding <i>distrust</i> of the
parcels post. Following is his question:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Is it not a <i>fact</i> that the <i>great mail order houses</i> of the country are the ones who
are <i>really</i> in favor of the parcels post?</p>

</div>

<p>There is real intellectual magneto and lamp equipment for you.
Note, too, the <i>shrewdness</i> of this Missouri “farmer” in wording his
question&mdash;the mail order houses may not be the <i>only</i> ones who favor
the parcels post, but they are about the only ones who “<i>really favor</i>” it!</p>

<p>Well, there are over 40,000,000 residents of the country&mdash;villages
and towns in this country&mdash;among them, too, are twenty millions of
<i>real</i> farmers. These are pretty firmly of opinion that <i>they</i> “are
really in favor of the parcels post.” There are, also, not <i>less</i> than
30,000,000 <i>more</i> residents of incorporated cities, small and large,
who at least <i>think</i> they favor a parcels post service which will permit
“mother” to send a pair of pants to her boy ten miles away as <i>cheaply</i>
as the laird of Skibo Castle, Scotland, can send two pairs of kilts to
a son of his friend’s Aunt Billy who lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>Of course, the people may only <i>think</i> they think and are sitting
up nights with the windows open and their ears spread to hear <i>their</i>
representatives tell ’em they are wrong. If so, Mr. Caulfield and
Mr. Lever will probably hear from them. It takes the people some
time to recognize or properly to appreciate how wise some of their
representatives are&mdash;what a <i>vast</i> amount of charges-prepaid
wisdom they have. But the people finally catch on and then&mdash;well,
then there will not be so many “farmers” of the Mr. Lever variety in
Congress.</p>

<p>But I want to give Mr. Lever another show. He’s entitled to
it “under the rules.” He should have several of them&mdash;not to show
his profound knowledge of the value and <i>dangers</i> of an efficient,
<i>cheap</i> parcels post, but to show that a man need not spend a cent in
Congress to advertise the fact that he is a “practical politician.”
All he needs do is make a few <i>hired</i> or <i>ignorant</i> remarks on some
subject <i>about which the people of the country have been thinking</i>.</p>

<p>Here is Mr. Lever’s answer to Mr. Caulfield’s question, as previously
quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The wisdom of <i>discriminating in favor of the local merchant</i> must be apparent
to <i>any one</i> who regards, for a moment, the <i>danger</i> involved in a system (parcels
post) which would <i>inevitably centralize</i> the <i>commerce of the country</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, candidly, how <i>could</i> a “friend” of a parcels post service
show his friendship more <i>nicely</i> than that? Especially if he is a
“farmer?” Or even if he is not, and merely <i>desires</i> the farmers to
<i>think</i> he is their friend?</p>

<p>Why, Mr. Lever has Mr. Caulfield shoved clear over the ropes
in that answer. Mr. Caulfield, of Missouri, may have full magneto
and lamp equipment, but Mr. Lever, when it comes to a <i>friendly</i>,
high-speed spurt for a parcels post service, shows <i>all</i> the latest improvements.
No, sirs, Mr. Lever is not merely a last year’s model.
He’s <i>bang</i> up-to-date&mdash;axles, drawn steel; forged crank shaft with
eight cams integral; continuous bearings and bearings all ground;
two water-cooled, four-cylinder motors with <i>sliding</i> gear; “built-in”
steel frame, and running on a “wheel-base” of 106 inches. Mr. Lever
shows all the other “latest,” <i>necessarily</i> belonging to the “best seller”
class among late models.</p>

<p>However, I have probably mentioned enough to make it clear
to my readers, if <i>not to his constituents</i>, that Mr. Lever is fully equipped
to <i>act</i> the part of the farmer’s “friend,” a friend of the parcels post,
or of any other old thing. Some may think he carries a little too
much weight for a good hill-climber. It should be remembered,
however, that some sorts of “friends” do not climb hills. They skip
around the hills and get what <i>they</i> are after while we are climbing.
When farmers and others of our producing classes wise-up to the brand
of vocal friendship I am “insinuatin’ about,” such representatives as
Mr. Lever will <i>last</i> about as long as it would take a one-armed,
wooden-legged man to fall off the top of the Flat Iron Building flag
pole.</p>

<h3>PARCELS POST “TESTS.”</h3>

<p>It may as well be said here as elsewhere that such “tests” of the
feasibility and desirability of a good parcels post service as Mr. Hitchcock
proposes to make are but procrastinating foolery. Great Britain
and every continental country of Europe has an efficient parcels post
service in operation.</p>

<p>Postmaster Generals and railroad and express company raiders
know that. The countries indicated have made all the “tests” we
need have of people-serving parcels post, and every one of them derive
more or less revenue from that service, there being no deficits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Postmaster Generals and our railroad and express company
raiders know all that. So, also, do our Senators and Congressmen
know that. Even alleged “farmer” Congressmen know it.</p>

<p>Our public servants know even more than that. They know
that under the International Postal Union agreements our government
has entered into, our postal service today handles these foreign
countries’ parcels, of either United States or of foreign origin, weighing
up to eleven pounds. They also know our own postal service now
won’t permit our own people to send by mail, packages weighing
more than four pounds. They also know that for carrying a four-pound
parcel by his own mail service the American must pay 64 cents
if the parcel is for delivery in any of the foreign countries covered by
Postal Union agreement,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but if sent by some one in any of those countries
for delivery in this, the sender may make up a parcel weighing
as much as eleven pounds and for its delivery will have to pay only
48 cents.</p>

<p>I say that our mail carriers and public officials know these things.
The facts as stated must be known of the Postal Union agreements.
On request, the Postoffice Department does not hesitate to give this
information to anyone. The following is a paragraph taken from a
department communication. It was sent in response to a request
made by Mr. Alfred L. Sewell, who wrote a most informative communication
that appeared in the Chicago Daily News of date
November 6, 1911. I take the quotation from Mr. Sewell’s article.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mailable merchandise may be sent by parcels post to Bahamas, Barbadoes,
Brazil, Bermuda, Bolivia, Danish West Indies (St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas),
Colombia, Ecuador, British Guiana, Costa Rica, Guatemala, British Honduras,
Republic of Honduras, Haiti, Jamaica (including Turk islands and Caracas),
Leeward Islands, Windward Islands, Mexico, Newfoundland, Nicaragua, Peru,
Salvador, Trinidad, Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela, in the western hemisphere,
and to Australia, Japan and Hongkong in the east, and to Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway and Sweden in Europe. The postage rate is uniform at 12 cents a pound,
or fraction of a pound. A parcel must not weigh more than eleven pounds, nor
measure more than three feet and six inches in length, or six feet in length and
girth combined.</p>

</div>

<p>Then why prattle about a “test” as to the desirability and
practicability of a good, cheap parcels post service in this country; one
that will serve our own people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Especially why prattle about such a parcels post service on a few
selected rural routes? It is not only foolishly silly, but it looks
suggestively wrong&mdash;as if there was some ulterior motive back of
any suggestion of such a test. “Why?”</p>

<p>Well, if such test is made under regulations suggested by the
Postmaster General, the only parcels that service, or “test” service,
is designed to carry, are such as originate on a selected rural route and
are for delivery on the same route or on a route immediately connected
with it. That is, as I understand Mr. Hitchcock’s recommended
regulations, any farmer or villager along the selected “test” rural
route may send a package (weight and rate of carriage yet to be decided
upon) to any other farmer or villager on the same route or connected
route, or to a resident of the town or city at which such route
originates or starts.</p>

<p>If such a farce can be seriously thought of as a “test” of what use
and economic value a nation-wide parcels post service would be to our
people, even to the people residing on the test routes, it will take
some graduate of a foolery school or foreman in a joke foundry to so
think of it.</p>

<p>Let’s see. A farmer may send a jar of butter, box of eggs, crate
of fruit or vegetables, etc., to the village storekeeper and get his pay
for the consignment, “in trade” usually. By writing the storekeeper
an order, postal card or letter, the farmer may get on the next
round of the carrier what he desires. That is, he will get what he has
asked for if the storekeeper has it in stock. The farmer, or the farmer’s
wife, may do the same thing in the event that the consignment
of their products, presuming that the “regulations” will permit the
carrier to handle perishable goods, goes no farther away than the
county seat or other town or city from which the rural route starts.
They can also send such parcels to any railroad station on the route
for shipment to any more distant point. In such case, however, the
farmer must pay an express carriage charge from the local railroad
station to the destination of his shipment.</p>

<p>But enough of this local application of the proposed “test” regulations.
It will readily be seen that if the farmer or villager on a
selected test route desires to send a parcel, not above the regulation
weight&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;to any point not on the same route,
he will have an express charge to pay&mdash;whatever that charge may be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
And if he orders something, inside the regulation weight, from some
factory or city not on his carrier’s route, he must also pay an express
charge for its carriage to his local railroad station. If he wants the
article or goods delivered at his home by the rural carrier, he must
pay an additional charge&mdash;the postal carriage charge, whatever that
may be.</p>

<p>As a “test” of the service value of a parcels post, could anything
be more absurd? If so, it would be difficult to frame it up. Such a
“test,” however, will still leave the raiding express companies in
position to hold up the selected “home circle,” rural-route residents
on all shipments, which go to or come from any city or point outside
the home circle&mdash;and that is about what, if not just what, the proposed
“test” is designed or intended to do, or so it appears from the ladder
top.</p>

<p>In this connection it should be noted that the rural-route delivery
enactment, or the department regulations under which it was to be applied,
carried an express protecting “joker.” If not, why was the rural
route carrier required to furnish a cart or other carrying vehicle of
only twenty-five pounds capacity? Was it valid for ulterior reasons
which named so small a weight? Would it have cost the government
any more money for rural carrier service if a maximum weight of 500,
or even of 1,000 pounds, had been named for the carrying vehicle?</p>

<p>The reader may answer. To The Man on the Ladder, though,
that 25-pound requirement looks to be of doubtful mail-service
value, if, indeed, not suspiciously queer.</p>

<p>It was carefully figured in 1900 that our rural, or non-railroad,
communities alone lost $90,000,000 a year in excessive express
charges and delays in delivery by reason of the <i>criminal</i> apathy of
their government in the matter of furnishing even a <i>reasonably</i>
adequate domestic parcels post service, such, for instance, as that
furnished by the German government. The German government
carries an 11-pound package anywhere in the German empire or in
Austria-Hungary <i>for 12 cents</i>.</p>

<p>To aid the reader, I give, following, a table covering the data
essential to a fair understanding both of the excessive pay for a
service which our government should render for a <i>tenth</i> of the money
and, also, of <i>why</i> our express service is inconvenient&mdash;is <i>wasteful
and expensive</i>&mdash;by reason of the <i>distance</i> the express offices are from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the people ordering. This last is clearly shown by comparing their
<i>number</i> with the larger number of postoffices in the several states
named.</p>

<p>Had I the space at command I would print the figures for the
whole United States. However, it will be seen that the states I
have taken are fairly representative of the whole country&mdash;the
populous with the sparsely settled.</p>

<p>The figures as to number of express and postoffices are from the
United States census for 1900.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The estimates are made on the parcel
weight of 11 pounds. Eleven pounds is the English <i>domestic</i> parcels
weight that is carried anywhere in the United Kingdom for 24 cents
or, by international postal agreement, to any point in this country
for 48 cents. In passing, it might be noted that for the year 1900 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
British postoffice turned into its national treasury over $18,000,000
<i>profit</i>. It might also be well to notice that English merchants
<i>imported</i> nearly five and a half million dollars value by parcels post
and <i>exported nearly twenty and a half million dollars of value by
means of the same service</i>.</p>

<p>But to get back to our 11-pound parcel.</p>

<p>Germany carries it anywhere in her empire or in Austria-Hungary
for 12 cents.</p>

<p>Switzerland carries it for <i>eight cents</i>, and several other countries
<i>are now trying to reach the German weight-rate for domestic delivery</i>.</p>

<p>So we will take as our package of <i>eleven pounds</i> and figure its
delivery at any postoffice in the United States for <i>twelve cents</i>.</p>

<p>One more point about this table.</p>

<p>The reader must keep in mind that we now deliver packages
up to eleven pounds from any person&mdash;merchant, manufacturer or
other&mdash;living in England, Germany or Mexico. It is delivered for
the English shipper (<i>by our mails</i>) to any United States postoffice for
48 <i>cents</i>; for the German shipper for 58 cents or for the Mexican
shipper for 66 cents.</p>

<p>The <i>three right-hand</i> columns of the table show how much <i>cheaper</i>
the English, German or Mexican merchant, or other shipper, can have
his eleven pounds of merchandise carried to Rabbit Hash, Ky.,
Springtown, Mo., Gold Button, Cal.&mdash;<i>to any postoffice in the United
States</i>&mdash;than the New York merchant can send his 11-pound parcel to
the <i>express office</i> “nearest” the customer ordering.</p>

<p>The express charges given are the <i>carefully figured averages</i> for
the states named for carriage from New York City. The third column
gives the <i>average</i> express charge (at rates ruling in 1900) from New
York City to the states named. The fourth column gives the
<i>savings</i> to the purchaser&mdash;the merchant or the consumer&mdash;if the
11-pound parcel were carried, as it should be carried, in the mails for
12 cents. The first two columns give the number of express offices
and postoffices in the several states named and are intended as
<i>conclusive</i> proof that <i>millions</i> of our people are much nearer to a postoffice
than to an express office.</p>

<p>With this preliminary, let us now comment on the table.
Don’t side-step it because it’s figures&mdash;unless, of course, you’re some
<i>hired man</i> of the express or railroad companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The total of express companies in the footing is that given in the
census report for 1900. There are probably several hundred more now.
The corresponding total given for the number of postoffices is correct
for July 1, 1910. There are fewer postoffices now than in 1900, the
establishment of rural route delivery having reduced the number
greatly. The reader must keep in mind that the figures named in
headings of the three right-hand columns cover a “delivery” charge
in addition to the home-rate mailing rate for the countries named.
This delivery charge was covered in the international agreements.</p>

<p>If the reader will study that table a little he will learn several
things.</p>

<p>If we have one hundred millions of people in this country, there
is an express office for about each 5,000 of them, while there is a
<i>postoffice</i> for about each 1,666 of them.</p>

<p>There is an <i>express</i> office to about every 175 <i>square miles of our
territory</i>, while there is a <i>postoffice</i> for about each 60 square miles of
our territory.</p>

<p>The reader will have no trouble to see by the table that, if he
ordered an 11-pound lot of hose and shirts or phonograph records,
photograph films or other goods from New York City for delivery in
Chicago, he would get the goods by a properly served parcels post for
just 97 cents <i>less carriage charge</i> than he now pays the express companies.
If he live in Los Angeles, Cal., he would get the goods from
New York for $3.04 less. Even if he lived in Buffalo, N. Y., he would
get those eleven pounds of goods from the metropolis of his state for
<i>48 cents less than he now pays the express companies</i>.</p>

<p>Be sure, however, to notice those three right-hand columns.</p>

<p>You will observe that the Right Honorable John Bovine, an
exporting merchant of London&mdash;or a <i>manufacturer</i>, if you please,
of Manchester or Leeds, England&mdash;can send that 11-pound package
to you in Chicago, Hot Springs, Fargo or elsewhere in the United
States&mdash;<i>send it by mail</i>, which no American merchant or manufacturer
can do&mdash;at from 90 cents to $3.00 <i>less carriage cost</i> than the New York
merchant can send it to you by express&mdash;<i>the only means our present
laws and methods permit him to use</i>.</p>

<p>Baron Von Stopper, an exporter of Berlin, likewise has a large
advantage over the New York merchant in supplying your <i>parcel</i>
demands. Even Senor Greaser of the City of Mexico, can ship&mdash;<i>by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
mail</i>&mdash;eleven pounds of kippered tamales or sombreros to any
point in the country, save ten states within short-haul range of New
York City, and have an <i>edge</i> of 30 cents to $3.23 over his New York
City competitor in supplying your <i>parcel order wants</i>.</p>

<p>Great, is it not? Fine system, is it not, to “protect <i>home
industries</i>?” To build up “foreign trade?”</p>

<p>But, it is not quite so bad as it looks for the very reason that our
“postal agreements” recognize the “tariff wall” that is built around
<i>certain</i> “infants” in this country. Your goods from England, Germany
or Mexico must be of our “<i>free</i> list” kind, otherwise they must
pay a rake-off to the government. As that is pretty stiff, <i>you</i> don’t
order many parcels from abroad. You buy home products&mdash;<i>thus
paying the tariff rake-off to the protected “infant” instead of the Government</i>.</p>

<p>Does it not appear that we American citizens are an easily
“worked” bunch?</p>

<p>In connection with the tabulation just presented, should be noted
the fact that <i>millions</i> of our people live in non-railroad communities&mdash;live,
often, <i>many miles from any express office</i>, while a postoffice may
be near. If these people have pressing need for any article of merchandise
weighing over four pounds it cannot reach them, under
existing law, by mail. <i>They must order it sent by express and make
the long drive to the nearest express office to get it.</i></p>

<p>The article may be one needed for the health of the family or it
may be a rod, a gear wheel or other part of some machine that has
broken in a critical hour of need&mdash;<i>any one of a hundred needs</i>, delay in
supplying which <i>costs money</i>.</p>

<p>It was carefully figured in 1900 that our rural, non-railroad communities
alone lost $90,000,000 <i>a year</i> in excessive express charges
and delays in delivery by reason of the peculiar if not studied apathy
of their government in the matter of furnishing even a <i>reasonably</i>
adequate domestic parcels post service.</p>

<p>The hypothetical rate (1 cent a pound or $20.00 per ton), for
parcels carriage and delivery by post is low&mdash;maybe a little too low.
If so, it is only a very little, <i>if it is figured to have the rate cover only
the actual cost of the service</i>. A nation-wide parcels post service, if
properly organized and directed, would, it must be remembered,
handle all the short as well as the long haul business. It would not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
as now, permit a collusive raiding arrangement between the railroads
and the express companies by which the latter get most of the short-haul
shipments and leave most of the long-haul parcels to be handled
by the mail service.</p>

<p>I see by a local press item, that the Senate Committee on Postoffices
and Postroads is going to propose in the bill it is drafting that
parcels of eleven pounds in weight be carried by the mail service for
50 cents&mdash;10 cents for the first pound and 4 cents for each additional
pound or fraction thereof, up to the maximum of 11 pounds. Of
course, a rate of 50 cents for the carriage of 11-pound parcels would
be a great betterment over the present rate and weight regulations.
But a rate of 50 cents for an 11-pound package is away too high,
figuring on short and long haul parcels, unless it is intended to make
the service a revenue producer, which it should not be. The committee,
I gather from the news item, has recognized the fact that a
50-cent rate is too high on short-haul matter and are considering the
recommendation of a lower rate for it&mdash;a distance scale or schedule
of rates. It is to be hoped that, if the proposed bill becomes law, it
will carry such a provision.</p>

<p>It is said the committee decided upon the weight and rate limits
after an “exhaustive investigation of all the parcels post systems of
the world,” and it was pointed out that this investigation disclosed
the fact that only “five powers” reported deficits in their postal
services in 1909&mdash;Luxemburg, Chili, Greece, Mexico and Austria&mdash;the
deficits ranging from $7,437 in Luxemburg to $1,693,157 in
Austria. Of these, it will be noted, all save Austria are small or only
partially developed countries. None of them have rail or other
transportation facilities at all comparable to those of this country.
Yet our government, with its excessive parcels rate and ridiculously
low maximum weight limit on parcels reported a deficit of $17,441,719.82
in its postal revenues for 1908-9, and $6,000,000 in 1910.</p>

<p>Whatever the action that may be taken by the present or a
future Congress looking to the betterment and to a cheapening of the
nation’s parcels post service, one thing must be done if such action
be made effective&mdash;if it yield the results it is alleged are expected of
it. Such action must carry provisions that will effectively break
up the present collusive understandings and arrangements between
the railroads and the express company interests, which arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
has for years been raiding the postal revenues on the one hand and, by
greatly excessive rail and express rates for carrying parcel freight,
has been looting the people on the other.</p>

<p>This can be&mdash;and should be&mdash;done. There are two actions which
may be taken by the government, either of which I believe would
accomplish that most desirable and necessary result.</p>

<p>On previous pages (pages 227 and 228), will be found quoted a
section of the law of 1845&mdash;a law for the establishing and regulation
of the government mail service. On the pages 256-257 will be
found a most instructive discussion of the law by Mr. Allan L. Benson.
Turn back and read those pages. Mr. Benson is always worth a
second reading.</p>

<p>That it was the intention of the legislators of that time to make
the carriage, handling and delivery of letters and “packets” (small
parcels or packages of any sort of mailable matter), a government
monopoly, there can be no valid reason to doubt. That the express
companies have operated and are operating in violation of Section
181 of that law, there can be no valid reason to doubt. That Section
181 of the enactment of 1845 is good, sound law today, there can be
no valid reason to doubt. That the express companies have operated,
and continue to operate, in violation of that law&mdash;in open defiance of
it&mdash;and are therefore engaged in a <i>criminal</i> traffic, there can be no
valid reason to doubt.</p>

<p>True, they have a very peculiar court decision to protect them
in their violation of that law. I call it a “peculiar” decision. A
more fitting term might be used in describing that court decision,
and the use of such a term would be fully justified.</p>

<p>One of the two actions which Congress might take would be to
amend Section 181 of its Revised Statutes so that even a yokel, as
well as a Federal Judge, may clearly see that the carriage of <i>packages
and parcels</i>, as well as of “packets,” which do not exceed the maximum
regulation weight and are of mailable class and kind, is “intended”
to be the <i>exclusive privilege of the government</i>.</p>

<p>Such an amendment to the law would force the express companies
out of business.</p>

<p>The other action which could be effectively taken would be to
make the parcels post rate so low and the maximum weight of parcels
so liberally high that the railroads and express raiders would quit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
their own accord, which they would do as soon as their present
tonnage of loot is seriously cut down. Nothing would cut into that
lootage deeper or quicker than would a service rated and weighted
parcels post.</p>

<p>I have been severe in my strictures and condemnation of the
express and railway raiders. In evidence that my condemnation is
deserved I desire to quote two or three people&mdash;people who have
made a careful, painstaking study of the game these raiders have
played, and yet play, and of the practices and tricks which make it a
“sure thing” for the high-finance gentlemen who play it.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert W. Atwood wrote a series of three most informative
articles for the American Magazine under the caption, “The Great
Express Monopoly.” They appeared in the American in its issues
for February, March and April, 1911. I trust the publishers will not
take unkindly my quoting Mr. Atwood. He presents some facts
which so conclusively evidence several points that I cannot resist
the appeal they make for quotation.</p>

<p>In evidencing the fact that the railroads own and control the
express companies and also showing how that ownership and control
was obtained and is maintained, Mr. Atwood writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It has frequently been asserted by merchants and shippers that the stock
issues of the express companies are merely a device to make possible the exaction
of unreasonable charges. Perhaps the most direct case in point is that of the
Pacific Express Company, organized in 1879 to do business on the Union Pacific
and Gould Railroads. Before the Indiana Railroad Commission John A. Brewster,
auditor of the company, recently testified that there were twelve stockholders
and $6,000,000 of stock. On pages 784-785 of the record there appears this
colloquy:</p>

<p>Q. What did you do with that stock, Mr. Witness?</p>

<p>A. The capital stock was given to the Wabash, Union Pacific, and Missouri
Pacific for the rights, franchises.</p>

<p>Q. For what rights?</p>

<p>A. Franchises and rights to do business.</p>

<p>Q. We begin to understand it; it wasn’t understood before that; nothing was
received by the Pacific Express Company for the issue of this $6,000,000 of stock?
Do these railroad companies own the stock?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q. These twelve stockholders are the railroads. The railroads get these
6 per cent dividends on the stock?</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Before another State Railroad Commission an officer of the company stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
so far as he knew and so far as the records show no cash was received for the
$6,000,000 stock. The Illinois Railroad and Warehouse Commission has decided
this stock was issued in fact and in law without consideration. Ostensibly the
stock was issued by the express company in exchange for the right to do business
over the lines of the railroads, but all the express companies pay a fixed percentage
of their gross receipts, ranging from 40 to 57½ per cent, to the railroads over which
they operate.</p>

</div>

<p>On the question as to whether express companies operate at a
profit or not, Mr. Atwood writes as follows of this same Pacific
organization:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whatever legal view we may take of this curious stock issue, there is
no room for doubting that it has served as a device for the extortion of money
from the shipping public, for express charges are made high enough to more
than pay dividends on the stock. Starting in business with no capital except
such as may have been temporarily loaned to it by the railroads in control, the
Pacific Express Company has paid dividends of $8,334,000 in twenty years and
in addition has been paying to the railroads, which owned all its stock, about
50 per cent of its gross receipts of more than $7,000,000 a year. A large block
of the stock recently changed hands at $200 a share, and yet we have seen how
it was issued without consideration in cash or property. Indeed it is said the
company operated for eight years before the stock was issued at all.</p>

</div>

<p>In speaking to the same point as applied to the United States
Express Company, Mr. Atwood calls attention to the fact that 55
per cent of its “stockholders” have entered suit to wind up the
company’s affairs on charges of mismanagement by its dominating
officers. Mr. Atwood further writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Although the gravest of charges of mismanagement and waste of assets have
repeatedly been made against the directors of the United States Express Company,
a profit of almost 15 per cent was earned by the company on the capital invested
in the express business in the year 1909. This profit would have been still greater
had general trade been normal, and had there not been a hiatus between the loss
of one large contract and the securing of another. That the stockholders have
not received all the profits proves nothing. Millions have gone into unnecessary
real estate investment and large salaries have been paid, but earnings on the
capital actually invested have clearly shown that even under a management
whose good faith and ability is being challenged in the courts there is an ample
return.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1875 a writer in Harper’s Magazine said the express business
had already created fifty millionaires, a statement which does not tax the credulity
of anyone who casts a glance at the dividend record of these companies. To use
the calmly judicial words of the Census Bureau: “In no other business is it
probable that so little money, comparatively, is invested where the gross receipts
are so large.” We have seen that new capital is not a necessity of the express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
business. Unlike the railroads, new security issues to raise capital are never sold
to the investing public.</p>

</div>

<p>The cappers for railroad and express interests, keep the atmosphere
agitated with talk about the “uncertainty and irregularity”
of the quantity of express matter to be carried, “the excessive taxes
paid,” etc. In answer to such bubble, Mr. Atwood has this to say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>While this may be theoretically true, the experience of years has shown that
the patronage of these companies has been fairly regular, remunerative and growing.
Not only will a study of the gross receipts prove this contention, but further
confirmation will be found in the remarkable series of excessive dividends. “We
do not feel that any extravagant return should be permitted upon the business
of these companies,” said the Interstate Commerce Commission in Kinde <i>v.</i>
Adams <i>et al.</i>, “for it involves none of the elements which entitle an investment to a
high return.”</p>

<p>When the Adams Express Company enriched its shareholders with a 200
per cent extra dividend in 1907, stress was laid upon the increase in taxation
throughout the country. How ridiculous this is can be seen from the fact that
the Adams Company paid only $145,184 in taxes in the entire fiscal year of 1909,
and $202,234 in 1910, although its extra dividend alone amounted to $24,000,000.
Profits on stock and bond speculation amounted to $418,979 in the year 1909, and
$1,943,889 in 1910. The American Express Company, with its huge resources,
paid but $283,951 in taxes in 1909. In the same year the volume of its banking
business alone amounted to more than $250,000,000. In at least one important
state, the express companies paid no taxes until a few years ago and in Indiana the
companies had the audacity to tell the Tax Commissioner that they had little or
no tangible property in that state. When Congress voted to put a tax of two
cents on every express transaction to raise revenue for the Spanish War the companies
made the shipper pay, and when the shippers objected fought the case to
the highest courts.</p>

<p>At this point the question naturally arises as to how the express companies
have been able to carry on for so many years such a perfect system of extracting
money from the public without being seriously molested. The answer involves a
knowledge of the relations existing between the railroads and the express companies,
and a knowledge of the complete monopoly which exists in the express
business&mdash;a monopoly made possible only because of these very relations.</p>

</div>

<p>In Pearson’s Magazine appeared two forcefully written articles
by Mr. Allen L. Benson on the parcels post. The articles appeared in
Pearson’s in February and March, 1911. In his February opening
and closing Mr. Benson says some things to us and says them with a
kindly bluntness which we should appreciate:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Is it a pleasure to you to be treated as if you were a fool? Do you never tire
of acting like an organ-grinder’s begging monkey?</p>

<p>These questions are put to you in good faith. I have no desire to insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
you. I know you are not a fool. I know you don’t like to beg. Yet here
you are again, with your little red cap on and your little tin cup out, begging
for a parcels post. Begging from those whom you should order. And the
gentlemen from whom you beg treat you as if you were a fool.</p>

<p>Perhaps you believe these statements are not so. I shall soon show you
that they are so. But before we go down this interesting parcels-post road,
let us hang a lantern to the wagon-tongue. You will understand the scenery
better if you see it by the light of this particular lantern. Here it is:</p>

<p>Bad government is largely made possible by the mistaken opinions held
toward each other by the governing classes and the governed. By “governing
classes” I don’t mean Presidents and Congresses. I mean the great capitalist
interests that make Presidents and Congresses. The governing classes underestimate
the intelligence of the people. That is why the governing classes are
always in process of yielding something to the people. Depending upon the
stupidity of the people, gross wrongs are inflicted that are righted only under force,
inch by inch.</p>

<p>The people, on the other hand, have too exalted an opinion of both the
intelligence and the patriotism of those who control the government. They
have no good opinion of the patriotic impulses of the great capitalists, but they
fail to note that the great capitalists are the National government. Mr. Morgan
in Wall street they recognize. But Mr. Morgan in Washington, disguised as
Uncle Sam, they do not recognize. Therefore they behold him with a certain
veneration. They have been taught, since childhood, to look up to Uncle Sam
as to a father. He is the government in breeches. The people do not always
agree with the men who govern them, but they always agree with the government.
The grand old government of the United States looks good to them. It looks
good to them because it seems to embody the power, the will and the virtue of
the people.</p>

<p>All of which is not true. No government is much better than the men who
control it. If the men who control it are bad, the government is bad. If a few
control it, the rest do not control it. If a few use it to get more than belongs to
them, the rest cannot use it to get what belongs to them. If a few control the
government to rob the rest of the people, the government is not the friend, but
the enemy, of the rest of the people.</p>

<p>The United States government is and long has been controlled by a few rich
men. These men have used and are using the government to enrich themselves
at the expense of the rest of the people. I do not mean so say that the government
never performs an act that is of service to all of the people, but I do mean to
say that when there is a conflict between the interests of the few who control the
government and the interests of the rest of the people, the government is almost
certain to take the side of the few as against the many.…</p>

<p>The little guiding group of rich who tell you that a high tariff helps you is the
same little guiding group that tells you a parcels post would hurt you.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Is it a pleasure to you always to be treated as if you were a fool? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
never tire of paying 16 cents a pound on mail packages limited to four pounds,
when there is hardly a little South American republic or fourth-class European
state that will not carry at least eleven-pound packages for a cent a pound or less?</p>

<p>Think of it&mdash;we have entered into agreements with forty-three nations that
have the parcels post to receive and deliver their parcels when directed to any
person in this country; we are permitting the Philippine Government to establish
a parcels post; we have agreed to receive in this country big packages at low rates
for delivery abroad; but we ourselves have no such rights among ourselves.
We must not only pay tribute to the express companies, but we must believe that
it is good for us to do so.</p>

<p><i>If the American people only knew their power; if they only knew their power!
If they would tear off their party labels and vote as they talk at home among their
neighbors, they could push this country half a century ahead at the next election.
Everybody knows something is wrong, but almost everybody votes the thoughts of
those who make the wrong.</i></p>

<p><i>Shall we never vote for ourselves?</i></p>

</div>

<p>The italics in the last paragraph quoted are mine. So, too, are
the sentiments of that paragraph&mdash;both the expressed and the implied.
That is I believe in them&mdash;I believe in them hard and stubbornly. If
my readers will think hard about them for a few minutes, I feel confident
they will conclude that it is about time for them, for all of us,
to act on Mr. Benson’s advice&mdash;tear off our party labels and begin
“to vote for ourselves.”</p>

<p>In support of his charges of bad faith on the part of the government
in giving the people a serviceable parcels post, Mr. Benson’s
remarks are most illuminating. He makes reference to a public or
semi-public document of the government, written by one Mr. Turner
and proceeds as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘This will open a great business for American retail merchants,’ wrote Mr.
Turner. ‘Brazil can be flooded with catalogues. This information, in advance,
will enable those desiring to go after business to prepare for it.’</p>

<p>“Mind you, these are only occasional sentences from his enthusiastic article.
He dwelt at length upon the eagerness of the Brazilians to buy such articles as we
make. He even became specific and enumerated some of the articles that could
be advantageously sent by parcels post. ‘This opens up great possibilities for the
retail shoe houses,’ he said, for instance, ‘as elegant shoes are worn.’ Also, there
was a great market for gloves, embroideries, ribbons, silks, stockings, and underclothing.</p>

<p>“Here, then, we have the spectacle of the United States Government making
statements to business men through a publication that the common people never
read, that are directly opposed to the statements that are made to the people
of the United States in congressional debates and other publications.</p>

<p>“Now, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would the establishment of a parcels post by Brazil, which we have permitted
to extend to this country, open any markets for Americans in Brazil if
parcels-post rates did not permit American merchants to deliver their goods in
Brazil at reduced cost?</p>

<p>“Again: If a parcels-post in Brazil will enable American merchants to lay
down their goods in Brazil at reduced cost, why wouldn’t a parcels post in the
United States enable American merchants to lay down their goods in the United
States at reduced cost?</p>

<p>“Furthermore: If reduced carrying charges would enable American merchants
to capture Brazilian trade by reducing selling prices, why wouldn’t reduced
carrying charges tend toward lower selling prices in the United States?</p>

<p>“Finally: Is there any reason on earth why the United States Government,
which is opposed to a parcels post in this country, through an official publication,
welcomes a parcels post in Brazil&mdash;is there any reason except the one fact that
there are no American express companies in Brazil?</p>

<p>“Figure it out for yourself. I have figured it out for myself. As I figure it
out, the United States Government is treating us as if we were a little weak in the
head; as if we are just foolish enough so that it was safe to print, in a semi-public
official publication, an acknowledgment that all of its excuses for not giving us a
parcels post are really impudent lies.…</p>

<p>“‘Should the mail trade have a government subsidy?’ asked one gentleman
who represented an association of jobbing firms. Let us see how much honesty
there is in this question. A subsidy implies the payment of money, either for
nothing, or for something that is not immediately received in return. That is
what these same rich gentlemen mean by subsidy when they ask you to subsidize
American ships. What element of subsidy would there be in a parcels post that
enabled the government to derive a great profit from the mail-order business?
We have all the machinery for handling ‘packets’&mdash;costly postoffice buildings,
cars, letter carriers, rural mail carriers. Why not use them? Why not let the
rural mail carrier, whose average load is now 25 pounds, carry 500 pounds at a
cent a pound? The postoffice department would earn $40,000,000 more a year
if the rural wagons were loaded to the 500-pound limit.</p>

<p>“‘The fact is,’ said the same jobber gentleman, ‘that the United States Government
cannot carry merchandise by parcels post without having to meet an enormous
annual deficit for conducting the service.’ The fact is that the fact isn’t.
What brazen effrontery to declare that the government would lose money carrying
packages at a cent a pound, when the German government makes money by
carrying packages at a little more than half a cent a pound! It is true that
German rates are based upon distance, but it is also true that Germany, without
any mail monopoly, competes with all comers and beats them out with low tariffs.
The German government can compete with the German express companies
because the German parcels post will accept packages up to a weight limit of
110³⁄₁₀ pounds, while our Government turns over to the express companies
everything that weighs more than four pounds.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, if the carrying of packages is such a hazardous business that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
our Government should not dare to attempt it, how comes it that the express
companies have become rich at it? The combined capital of the express companies
is a little in excess of $48,000,000. For years, the big stockholders in
express companies have been apoplectic with wealth. All of this money came
from somewhere. All of this money came from those who consumed products
sent by express. Only a few weeks ago the Interstate Commerce Commission
brought out the fact that the Adams Express Company’s business in New England
yielded a profit, in 1909, of 45 per cent, upon the investment. Yet, there was
nothing brought out in the proceedings to show, that the Adams Express Company
was gouging New England any harder than it was the rest of the country, or that
the other express companies were not doing to the rest of the country approximately
what the Adams was doing to New England. If you had the Government’s
equipment for handling express matter, would you feel particularly frightened
at a proposition to give you a monopoly of the ‘packet’ business at an average rate
almost twice that of the German Government’s average rate?”</p>

</div>

<p>Knowing that my readers have not wearied of Mr. Benson, I
shall presume to take further liberties with his articles on our subject.
His handling of the point I have raised&mdash;railroad control of the
express companies&mdash;is so informative and so able that I would do
neither my readers nor my subject justice were I not to quote him
and do it right here:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The railroads have become the express companies, not in legal fiction, but in
transportational fact. The railroads largely own the express companies, entirely
control the express companies, and, to all intents and purposes, are the express
companies. We, the highly intelligent American people, simply don’t know these
facts. Never has it seemed to occur to us that, since Benjamin Harrison was
President and John Wanamaker was in his cabinet, the express grafters may have
devised improved ways of working the express graft. Therefore, in this parcels
post matter, we don’t know who is pushing the knife that we feel between our ribs.
We accuse the express companies. A man who was being murdered might as well
accuse the shadow of his murderer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the facts that follow will show you who are behind the shadows of
the express companies. I quote from Senate Document No. 278, Sixtieth Congress:</p>

<table summary="Figures from Senate Document No. 278 about stock and holdings">
  <tr>
    <td>Stock held by railways in express companies</td>
    <td class="right vb">$20,668,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Railway securities owned by express companies</td>
    <td class="right vb">34,542,950</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Holdings of express companies in the stock of other express companies</td>
    <td class="right vb">11,618,125</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Since this article was written (Mr. Benson adds in a footnote) the Interstate
Commerce Commission has issued a report in which railroad holdings in
express stock are given at $14,124,000. The same report says the “total book
value of property and equipment of 13 express companies is $22,313,575.53.”
The figures furnished by the express companies are evidently somewhat bewildering
to the commission, which, having found the total value of the express companies’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
assets to be $186,221,380.54, remarks: “It is evident that the capital
stock of these companies bears no relation to the amount invested in the express
business.” On the face of the Interstate Commerce Commission’s report, the
railroads have disposed of more than $6,000,000 worth of express stock since the
United States Senate investigated the matter during the life of the Sixtieth
Congress. Yet there is no mention of such a transaction, and it seems exceedingly
unlikely that the railroads have suddenly reversed their policies and become sellers
instead of buyers of express stock. What seems more likely is that both the railroads
and the express companies are continuing the policy to use figures to conceal
facts. Gentlemen who can give $186,000,000 worth of assets a “book value” of
$22,000,000 might have no difficulty in compelling figures to turn flip-flaps upon
almost any occasion.</p>

<p>Please notice that railroad companies&mdash;not railroad men, railroad companies&mdash;own
more than $20,000,000 of stock in express companies. The express companies
are capitalized at only $48,000,000. Railroad companies therefore own
almost half of the stock of the express companies. Railroad men like Mr. Gould,
the Vanderbilts and Mr. Morgan also own stock in express companies. Railroad
men presumably do not vote their private holdings of express stock in opposition
to the manner in which they vote the express stock owned by the railways they
control. But, even if railway men owned no express stock, the ownership by
railways of a solid block of more than $20,000,000 of express stock would enable
the railways to control the express companies. Mr. Morgan controls many corporations
in which he holds only a minority interest. It is the way of big men to
control more than they own.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Let us assume that you attach no significance to the ownership by the railways
of almost half of the stock of the express companies. You don’t believe
the railroads would take the trouble to get control of $3,500,000 more stock and
thus control the companies. You want to be shown.</p>

<p>All right. You don’t mind using your common sense? Good.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t railroad companies be incorporated fools if they didn’t control the
express companies? Couldn’t the railroad companies, if they cared to, control the
express companies, even though the railroad companies owned not a share of stock
in any of the express companies? What is an express company?</p>

<p>An express company is a corporation that is engaged in transportation. Not
a single express company owns a foot of railway track, a locomotive, a roundhouse
or a water tank. Not a single express company employs an engineer, a
fireman, a train dispatcher, or a section hand. Not a single express company
could carry a bar of soap from New York to Albany without using all of the
mentioned instruments of transportation, besides many others. In other
words, an express company is an institution engaged in transportation without
owning any of the means of transportation. It exists only by sufferance. So
long as railroad companies are willing to haul the cars of an express company, the
express company may do business&mdash;but no longer. An express company, if ill-treated,
has no other place to go. It cannot hire a department store company to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
haul its cars, nor a dry-goods firm, nor a manufacturer of hats. An express
company must go to railroads for its transportation facilities, accept the best
terms it can get, or go out of business.</p>

<p>Is it not so? How comes it, then, that you never hear of rows between
express companies and railroad companies? How comes it that the same railroads
that are always trying to squeeze you on freight rates apparently never try to
squeeze the express companies on rates for hauling cars? The express companies
are exceedingly fat birds. They are absolutely in the power of the railroad
companies. If you owned the only vacant house in the world and a wanderer
must rent from you or die in the street, you would not have him more completely
in your power than the railroad companies have the express companies.</p>

<p>Yet the railroad companies are frying the express companies to a frazzle.
The New York Central Railroad Company takes 40 per cent of the gross receipts
of the express company that operates over its lines. But the frying is entirely
friendly, and therefore the express companies do not cry out against it. A station
agent does not complain because the railroad company for which he works takes
from him the money for the tickets he has sold. He expects to give up the
money. The officers of express companies expect to give up the money they take
in. That is what they are there for. If they were otherwise disposed they would
not be there. The $20,000,000 block of express stock held by railroads would
keep them out. Can you imagine an express company giving 40 per cent of its
gross receipts to a railway company if the directors of the express company were
not controlled by the railway company?</p>

<p>Please get the full meaning of that New York Central arrangement. It is
not a mere matter of 40 per cent. It is a matter of 40 per cent of the gross receipts
and then perhaps 50 per cent of what is left. In other words, the railroad company
first takes, as a carrier, four-tenths of the express company’s receipts. As a
stockholder in the express company, the railroad next takes almost half of the
net profits.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>In both surveying the Canadian express situation and giving the order to
reduce rates, Judge Mabee, chairman of the commission, said:</p>

<p>“Cut short of all the trimmings, the situation is that the shipper by express
makes a contract with the railway company through the express company. The
whole business could go just as it now does without the existence of any express
company at all by simply substituting railway employees and letting the railways
take the whole of the toll in the first instance.”</p>

</div>

<p>As showing how freight tariffs are manipulated by the railroads
to force the people to make light shipments by express and pay the
looting rates the express companies charge, the following by Mr.
Benson should be read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In what essential particular does the conduct of the American express
business differ from the conduct of the Canadian express business? The Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
express companies collect money from the public and hand it over to the railroads.
What do our express companies do?</p>

<p>At this point, some gentlemen may be moved to ask. Why is an express
company? At first glance, it does seem rather strange that the railroads should
bother to do business through express companies if the railroads not only haul the
express cars, but get the money the public pays. Yet there is nothing strange
about it, as we shall see when we consider what the express business is.</p>

<p>Part of the express business is an effort to commit a crime for pay. The
rest of the express business is an effort to perform a service at an exorbitant rate
of compensation. In other words, part of the express business is the carrying of
“packets” that should be sent only by mail, and the carrying of which by a private
person or corporation is a crime, and the rest of the business is the carrying of light
freight that should go by fast freight at a rate much below the express rate.</p>

<p>The express business, like every other business that has thriven, was based
upon a public need. The public need was for a fast freight service for light freight.
The railroad managers of forty years ago were not disposed to give the service, but
they were willing to haul cars for an express company that wanted to carry fast
freight at a high rate.</p>

<p>In this small, timid way the express business began. The crime of carrying
mail in competition with the government had never been considered. When
shippers offered mailable packages for transmission, they were accepted, but
postage stamps were affixed to comply with the law. Even the volume of light
freight was relatively small. The railroads themselves kept all of the light freight
traffic they could. It was not until the railroads invested heavily in and obtained
control of the express companies that deliberate efforts were made to
compel the public to send light freight by express.</p>

<p>Let me explain precisely what I mean by this. The minimum freight rate
from Chicago to North Platte, Neb., is $1.10. Whether a package weighs five
pounds or 100 pounds, the charge is the same.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to send a ten-pound package. A dollar and ten cents
seems an exorbitant charge, especially when the fact is considered that a ten-pound
package, sent by freight, probably would not reach its destination in less
than ten days. You look up express rates and find that you can send the package
for 55 cents, with a certainty of delivery within forty-eight hours. Of course you
send the package by express.</p>

<p>What has happened? Apparently, the express company has saved you 55
cents. Actually, the railroad company has clubbed you into the clutches of the
express company. The railroad company never expected you to pay $1.10 for
the transmission of a ten-pound package. In the good old days when the express
companies were not owned by the railroad companies, and the railroad companies
were not controlled by a little group of men in Wall Street, the freight rates for
ten-pound and hundred-pound packages were not the same. The railroads
wanted to carry small packages and made rates that brought them in. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
express companies showed the possibility of collecting a higher rate for quick
delivery. For this reason, a certain amount of business naturally came to the
express companies. But after the railroads obtained control of the express
companies, resort was had to artificial means to drive business over to the high-priced
express companies. The freight rate for 100 pounds was established <i>as the
minimum rate</i> for all lighter packages. No one is expected to pay this exorbitant
rate, but it is there for everyone to look at.</p>

<p>Slow freight delivery is also apparently employed by the railroads to compel
the public to ship by express. If one have a full hundred pounds to send a short
distance, he will find the minimum freight rate lower than the express rate. But
he will also have reason to believe that freight trains are drawn by snails. The
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central recently struggled ten days to
bring a hundred-pound package forty miles to me. An express company would
have performed the same service over-night. If the railroads had wanted the
business, they would have required no more than two days.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, I have quoted extendedly from both Mr. Atwood and Mr.
Benson. I have done so, because they wrote not only what I have
quoted but much more that I would like to quote, and each of them
has handled his subjects pointedly and forcefully conclusive. The
call for “copy” by my publisher, will, I trust, argue my excuse with
the publishers of Pearson’s and The American magazines for having
drawn so largely upon their columns without first asking and securing
their permission to do so.</p>

<p>But it seems to me I can hear some barker for the interests barking
“Yellow writers! Yellow magazines!”</p>

<p>A few years since, the fling of that appellation “yellow” may
have had some influence&mdash;probably did have some influence among
the thoughtless. But millions of the then indifferent and thoughtless
people have become serious and thoughtful recently. To such
there is no opprobrium in the word “yellow” as the barkers fling it at
newspapers and magazines which attack and tell the truth about the
interests for which the barkers bark. In fact, the word has become
an appellation of honor rather than of discredit&mdash;of repute rather than
of disrepute.</p>

<p>Here is another quotation&mdash;two of them. They are from an
article in Pearson’s Magazine, February, 1912, issue. Get the magazine
and read the whole article. The article is captioned “The
Railroad Game.” It will richly compensate you:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I chanced to meet a man who is now president of one of the great Western
railroad systems. He chided me good-naturedly about my antagonism to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
railroads. Finally he said: … “You are too big a man to be fighting
the railroads. Come get into the game with us. It isn’t how much money we
make, but how much we can conceal that counts in the railroad business.”</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>These figures do not take into consideration at all the operations of the
numerous express companies which impose upon the people a burden approximating
$125,000,000 a year while their actual investment for all purposes does
not exceed $6,000,000 a year. These companies all earn prodigiously. All pay
big dividends. All have big surplus funds, and frequently have big melon cuttings.
In one of these a few years ago $24,000,000 were distributed among the
stockholders of a single company. And after all, these companies amount in
actual service to the people to no more than a parcels post which the government
should have established long ago. With government control of the railroads
this pernicious form of extortion would end. In European countries express
companies do not exist. There the parcels post is supreme, satisfactory to the
people and remunerative to the governments.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, the writer of the above when he mentions $6,000,000
as the “actual investment for all purposes” means all the actual investment
for all express service purposes. In that statement he is
entirely correct.</p>

<p>But who is the writer? Well, the man who made the statements
just quoted is Mr. O. C. Barber, the American “Match King.”
Certainly no one&mdash;not even the most courageous and venturesome
hired liar of the raiding combinations&mdash;will call Mr. Barber “yellow.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Well, Mr. Barber has a lot of real long-headed and
hard-headed sense. He also has <i>money</i>. He has a <i>whole lot</i> of money.
That makes Mr. Barber a “strong” man, as Mr. Benson puts it, in the
calculating eyes and minds of public bubblers. Not only has Mr.
Barber money, but, as Pearson’s editor points out, “he is a man of
affairs.” He has been a man of affairs for fifty years. He is an
officer or director in companies which have a capital of fifty million
dollars. Their combined freight shipments are from 150,000 to 200,000
cars per year, and go to all parts of the world.</p>

<p>No, there is nothing of the yapped “yellow” about Mr. Barber.
When the barkers bark of him, the trajectory of their language will
carry it scarcely beyond the walls or to the banqueters. In most
cases the barker’s voice, when adversely criticising Mr. Barber, will
take that humble, pendant expression so universally characteristic
of the tail of a scared dog.</p>

<p>Mr. Barber is “strong.” If you don’t know it get the February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
1912, Pearson’s and read his article on “The Railroad Game.” You
will know it then.</p>

<p>The clackers who clack for those who profit by the outrageous
parcels post service in this country now, will tell you, of course, that
Germany, France and some other countries can “afford” to give their
citizens lower postal carriage rates, “because the governments own
the railroads and have their mails carried free.”</p>

<p>It is sufficient to say in answer to such clack that if we can have
a cheap, efficient parcels post service <i>only by owning the railroads</i>,
then let us own them.</p>

<p>Why not? A good, cheap parcels post service is worth it&mdash;worth
it to you, to me, to every man, woman and child of the country,
both to those living and to the generations yet unborn.</p>

<p>Yes, sirs, such a parcels post service is worth <i>more to our people
than our railroads cost to build</i>, or would cost to rebuild or to buy.
Why do I say that? I say it <i>because</i> it is a <i>fact</i>&mdash;a fact that needs but
a line or two to evidence.</p>

<p>1. Such a parcels post service would save our people <i>more</i> than
$300,000,000 every year.</p>

<p>2. At 2 per cent (a rate at which the government can borrow
all the money it wants), three hundred million dollars would pay the
interest on $15,000,000,000.</p>

<p>3. Fifteen billions of dollars is <i>more</i> than either the “book” or
the “market” value of <i>all</i> the railroads in this country&mdash;“water”
included. It is more than <i>twice</i> their tangible, or construction, value.</p>

<p>So, if we can have cheap, reliable parcels post service only when
the “government own the railroads,” then let’s get busy.</p>

<p>One of the much <i>worn</i> objections to a cheap parcels post service
is that it cannot be established and <i>profitably</i> operated, as it has been
in those countries which <i>own</i> the mail-carrying roads and pay much
<i>lower salaries</i> to the operators of the service.</p>

<p>In reply, I will say that in neither Great Britain, nor in <i>any
country of continental Europe</i> are <i>all</i> the rail-mail roads <i>owned</i> by the
government. But those countries do <i>control</i> all their railroads&mdash;and
that is exactly what this government must soon do <i>or the railroads
will control it</i>.</p>

<p>To tell <i>how</i> these governments got control <i>and keep control</i> of
their railroads is another story. In fact, it is a story for each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
countries. Suffice it to say here that they <i>do</i> control them. One
element of that control <i>compels</i> the railroads to carry a <i>large portion
of the mails free of charge</i>.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, all regular trains carry at least one mail car
free, or at a mere nominal charge, and the trunk line roads are required
to turn out extra mail trains of ten cars each on demand of
the postoffice authorities. For such a train the road can charge <i>no
more</i> for the run than the <i>average cost of an average passenger train</i>.</p>

<p>France guarantees and, I believe, <i>pays</i> the interest on a 70,000,000
franc railway bond issues. That is equivalent to $14,000,000.
At 3 per cent the interest amounts to $420,000 a year. For that sum
the railroads carry all the <i>regular</i> mails free&mdash;carry them <i>under
government direction and stipulation</i>. Last year we paid our railroads
$49,330,638.24 for carrying our mails. The French roads also carry
the officials, the soldiery, and all military supplies <i>free</i>.</p>

<p>That, in brief, is about what the French government <i>compels</i> the
railroads of France to do.</p>

<p><i>And those roads are all paying fair returns on the money invested
in them!</i></p>

<p>It was only a few brief years since the railroads of the German
Empire were <i>all</i> in the hands of private owners&mdash;of “frenzied financiers”
who robbed both the government and the people in outrageous
mail, freight and passenger rates. Germans will not stand for such
conditions long. The people shouted aloud their grievances and
demanded redress&mdash;demanded a remedy.</p>

<p><i>The German government heard and heeded the demands of its
people.</i> It usually does. When it started to give its people relief it
was met on every hand with just the same sort of talk as has been
heard in this country for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>“You can’t cut down the rates, for the roads are now earning
barely enough to pay fair interest on the investment.”</p>

<p>“You can’t trespass upon the ‘sacred rights’ of property.”</p>

<p>“You can’t think of taking such action! Why, it would create
a financial upheaval&mdash;a panic&mdash;causing widespread disaster and
bankrupting the railway companies.”</p>

<p>“You cannot possibly be so inconsiderate as to endanger the
savings of the hundreds of thousands of widows and orphans who
have invested in our stocks and bonds”&mdash;and a lot more of like junk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a clear-headed, <i>clean</i>-minded
old German, with the <i>rugged honesty</i> for which his race is
justly noted. Well, this Chancellor listened with courteous dignity
to all their “you can’t do this,” “You can’t do that,” etc., until it was
made quite clear to his mind that frenzied financiers and railroad
grafters in his country were <i>dictating as to the powers and policies of
his government</i>.</p>

<p>What happened then? Why, as Creelman put in writing of the
incident, when this grand old Von heard enough of those “you
can’ts” to make their object and purpose clear to him, he jumped to
his feet and turned loose a few yards of forceful German language
which, translated, summarized and anglicized, would sound something
like this:</p>

<p>“<i>I can’t! Well, you just watch me!</i>”</p>

<p>“Did he give ’em anything worth looking at?” Oh, but didn’t
he? The honest old Von sat quietly into their <i>own</i> game, played with
their own <i>marked cards</i> and “beat ’em to a frazzle,” as our strenuous
ex-President would put it. Did he buy up the roads, paying for all
the <i>aqua pura</i> they had tanked up?</p>

<p>Well, hardly! It was <i>control</i> Von wanted, and <i>ownership</i> was
neither immediately nor particularly sought, <i>beyond the point necessary
to that control</i>.</p>

<p>As I remember the story, he quietly put some agents on the
floor of the Berlin stock bourse and before the gentlemen who had
handed him that miscellaneous assortment of “can’ts” knew what
had happened, <i>Von had control of one or two of the German trunk
lines</i>. Then the way he made those friends of the “poor widows and
orphans” <i>see</i> things was profoundly and, for a few weeks, almost
<i>exclusively</i> awful. He did not buy the road for his government.
He merely bought <i>control</i>.</p>

<p>His government having control, he next slashed all the silk and
frills <i>out of rail rates on the road or roads controlled</i>.</p>

<p>“What was the result?” Why, the “can’t” venders were on
their knees to him in six months. In a year the German government
<i>controlled</i> its railroads and there was not a railway patriot in the
Empire who was not busy telling the Chancellor how many <i>more
things</i> he could do, if he wanted to and, in fact, <i>urging</i> him to do some
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>And the “widows and orphans,” or other <i>legitimate</i> investors in
the securities of the German roads, <i>lost not one cent of earned income</i>
in the passing of <i>control</i> from private to government hands. As a
result, the German government is making money from its <i>owned</i>
railroads. The net revenues of the German Government from its
railroads is now annually about $250,000,000. From 1887 to 1906,
the roads paid into the government’s exchequer about $1,400,000,000.
It has saved money from its <i>controlled</i> roads and is furnishing its people
<i>a cheap and most serviceable</i> parcels post. So much for the cheap
foreign mail-carriage and <i>the way the “cheap foreigners” got it</i>.</p>

<p>Now, as to salaries paid. Mail carriers and clerks in this country
are paid something under $1,000 a year. Railway mail clerks are
paid an average of $1,165&mdash;<i>and the latter work only one-half the time
for full pay</i>. I have no information at hand as to the pay of mail
carriers and clerks in foreign countries, but I have the figures for the
pay of railway mail clerks in Great Britain, Germany and France.
So, we will make comparison of the pay in that class of service. They
stand as follows:</p>

<table summary="Comparative pay of railway mail clerks">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Per Year.</td>

    <td class="right">610</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There, now, you see the shocking disparity in the very <i>worst</i>
and <i>all</i> of its enormity&mdash;the way it is usually presented by “farmers”
in Congress who are <i>cultivating</i> express company crops. But let us
look into those figures a little further.</p>

<p>Information carefully collected and collated, both by official
and private agents, among the former being the Department of
Commerce and Labor of our own government, has <i>conclusively</i> shown
that <i>living</i> in England and in the countries of Continental Europe is
<i>from thirty to forty per cent cheaper than in this country</i>.</p>

<p>Let us take 30 per cent&mdash;the lowest reported estimate of the
difference in the cost of living&mdash;subsistence, clothing, housing,
schooling, amusements, etc.&mdash;and see how the figures look in comparison
as to pay of railway mail clerks:</p>

<table summary="Comparative pay of railway mail clerks adjusted for cost of living">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Per Year.</td>

    <td class="right">$1,165.00</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>enormity</i> of the difference, you will observe, is not so shockingly
enormous as it appears in <i>heeler’s</i> figures first shown. But
even the last set of figures does not afford a just comparison. Here
is why:</p>

<p>The English railway clerk is allowed $160 a year as “travel pay.”
The German rail man is provided <i>free</i> a house that is worth an annual
rental of $135 <i>in Germany</i>. Here, it would rent for from $240 to
$360. In addition to his “salary” the French railway mail clerk is
allowed $180 “travel pay” and is also provided <i>free</i> with a house of a
rental value of $80 per year&mdash;a house that would rent here at from
$160 to $300 per year. Making these little additions to the actual
service <i>pay</i> of those “cheap foreigners,” let’s see how they compare
with our “high salaried” railway mail clerks. We will figure the
“travel pay” allowances at its purchasing power <i>in buying a living</i>
and for the rent allowances we will add the lowest equivalent given
above of corresponding housing in this country.</p>

<p>On that basis the stack-up is as follows:</p>

<table summary="Comparative pay of railway mail clerks adjusted for cost of living and allowances">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Per Year.</td>

    <td class="right">1,288.57</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Those “cheap foreigners,” <i>who are efficiently operating a cheap
parcels post</i>, you see, come out of the wash in pretty fair shape after
all, when compared with our “high salaried” postal service men.</p>

<p>But even the last table does not present the whole truth as to the
<i>lie</i> so often yapped about by the <i>tools</i> of the private interests in this
country that are opposing the betterment and <i>cheapening</i> of our
parcels post service.</p>

<p>The railway mail clerks of England, Germany and France not
only get full pay while laid up from temporary injury, the same as do
our rail postal men, but their governments pay those “cheap foreigners”
<i>a pension</i> when they get old or are permanently injured&mdash;<i>pay
it for the remaining years those “cheap” mail handlers live</i>!</p>

<p>Among the most <i>brazen</i>, yet most frequently used, objections to
a cheap and serviceable parcels post is that it would “benefit but very
few people in the country’s vast population,” or other vocalized
breath of similar purport and <i>purpose</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Objectors who use this argument belong to one of two classes:
They are either fools or think <i>you</i> are, or they are men whose sense of
the right and wrong of things, commonly designated as conscience,
got lost in their transit from diapers to dress suits.</p>

<p>The “argument” is not worth a line of consideration were it not
so frequently used by objectors of the two classes just indicated. A
man&mdash;<i>a full-sized man</i>&mdash;who can give it more than a smile ought to
hire a janitor and a couple of scrub women to clean up his garret and
dust off its furnishings.</p>

<p>But, seriously speaking, let’s think a moment about “the few”
people who would be benefited by a cheap parcels post service.</p>

<p>There are 95,000,000 or more folks in this country.</p>

<p>There are about 36,000,000 of that number engaged in farming,
farm labor, stock-raising and other agricultural occupations, counting
the dependent families.</p>

<p>Counting the dependent families. Those “few” would be benefited,
would they not?</p>

<p>Counting wives and babies, there are somewhere around 22,000,000
of our folks engaged in the mechanical trades and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Those “few” would be benefited, would they not?</p>

<p>Among our folks are, counting families as before, not less than
16,000,000 domestic servants, saloon, hotel and restaurant people,
policemen, firemen, soldiers, sailors and laborers “not elsewhere
specified.”</p>

<p>Those “few” would be benefited, would they not?</p>

<p>Next, we have around 12,000,000 of bookkeepers, clerks, agents,
operators, teamsters, etc., “engaged in trade and transportation,”
again counting “the little ones at home” but <i>not</i> counting the “retail
merchants” nor the <i>railway manipulators</i>.</p>

<p>Those “few” would be benefited, would they not?</p>

<p>Next, we may enumerate among our people, doctors, lawyers,
teachers and other <i>professional folks</i>, counting their folks at home
the same as before, some 7,000,000.</p>

<p>Those “few” would be benefited, would they not.</p>

<p>Next we have&mdash;</p>

<p>But we have already found about <i>ninety-one millions</i> of the “few
people” among our folks who <i>would be benefited</i> by a cheap, serviceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
parcels post. That leaves somewheres around four millions to be
accounted for.</p>

<p>Again, including dependent families not less than 3,000,000 of
that number can be classed as retail merchants. Half of that
3,000,000 are merchants, dealers, manufacturers, etc., in the “larger
cities,” whom even the opponents of the parcels post have agreed
would be <i>benefited</i> by its service. At any rate it has been <i>demonstrated</i>
by organizations of merchants in the large cities that parcel
deliveries within a radius of thirty or forty miles of their stores, which
had cost from <i>eight to fifty cents</i>, can be made at an average cost <i>not
exceeding four cents</i>.</p>

<p>That leaves the country merchants, the jobbers, the railroad and
express company raiders and their hired opinion molders to account
for. Of these, the country merchant is by far the most numerous,
likewise the most deserving of consideration.</p>

<p>On a previous page I made it fairly clear, I think, that a good,
cheap parcels post service would be of great service to him. He has
the respect and the confidence of his customers. He knows the worth
of goods. He can sell the goods&mdash;any line or make&mdash;at the advertised
or catalogued price and <i>still make a good profit</i>, as I have previously
shown.</p>

<p>The parcels carriage charge, either by mail or express, is now so
high he is compelled to order in quantities to keep “laid-down-prices”
low enough to meet competition. A cheap parcels post service would
put him in position to meet the competition of the larger merchants of
<i>the cities. A line of samples</i>, showing the latest patterns, makes and
grades, could take the place of fully <i>half the shelf stock he now carries</i>,
aside from the staples. He could take the order of his customer and
have the goods delivered by parcels post either to his store or, if in a
rural delivery district, to the home of his customer for a few cents&mdash;<i>have
it delivered as cheaply as the big city merchant, manufacturer or
mail order house can have it delivered</i>.</p>

<p>Do not overlook that last point, Mr. Country Merchant, when
<i>hired</i> yappers are coaching you to oppose a good parcels post service.
The government will not pay “rebates” nor allow “differentials”
in its parcels carriage. You can put your packages through the mails
at as <i>low a charge</i> as that paid by a merchant <i>with millions of capital
invested in stocks of goods</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the objections now urged against a <i>domestic parcels</i> post in
this country, the dangers lurking in the <i>mail order house</i> is the most
industriously worked. “It would be a fine thing for the eastern
merchant to have a parcels post system whereby he could supply the
people throughout the country,” said a Mr. Louis M. Boswell, a few
years since when speaking to the National Association of Merchants
and Travelers, convened in Chicago.</p>

<p>And who, pray you, is or was Mr. Boswell? Why, Mr. Boswell
was one of the main cogs at that time, in the <i>Western freight traffic
wheels</i>. Mr. Boswell <i>talked for his personal interests</i>, and for those
interests only. To make his anti-parcels post talk <i>catch</i> his auditors&mdash;the
Western merchants&mdash;he even told the <i>truth</i> about the express
companies.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Freight should be transported as such by <i>railroads in freight cars</i>, and not by
the government in mail cars.… I have long regarded the express
companies as <i>unnecessary middlemen</i>.… <i>Millions of
dollars would be saved annually</i> to the public if the express companies were done
away with, and I do not believe the <i>revenues of the railroads would be decreased</i>.</p>

<p>“And what are you on earth for,” wrote a self-serving trade journal editor in
1900, “if not to look after <i>your own interests</i>? A parcels post …
will <i>knock your business silly</i>. You are the one entitled to the trade in your town
and neighborhood.”</p>

</div>

<p>I present the above quotations as <i>fair samples</i> of the “argument”&mdash;its
method and its <i>source</i>&mdash;against a domestic parcels post. Let it
be noticed that these two quoted statements&mdash;as is the case with
most of the other promotion talk against a parcels post&mdash;is talked or
addressed to <i>country, village, town and one-night-stand city merchants</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>mail order houses</i> “will knock your business silly!”</p>

<p>Now, of course, it must be admitted that, in this day of super-heated
service of <i>self</i>, a man’s <i>personal</i> interests must receive his <i>first</i>
consideration. But I cannot for the life of me see why these “Western
merchants and travelers” take the talk handed them by “traffic” cappers,
express company agents and <i>space muddlers</i>&mdash;take it in such
large <i>slugs</i>&mdash;and apparently overlook the fact that these talking and
writing bubblers <i>are serving special interests</i>. Can you understand it,
Mr. “Storekeeper” of Rubenville? Or you, Mr. “Merchant” of
Swelltown? Or you Mr. “Shipper” of Cornshock or Feedersville?</p>

<p>Mr. Benson in his March article in Pearson’s, says something
anent the great hue and cry which the raiders, aided in this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
case by merchandise jobbers and some of the larger department store
retailers, are trying to raise among country merchants and rural
residents about what a great “menace and danger” the mail order
houses would be if a cheap, serviceable parcels post was put into
operation. I hope my readers will carefully peruse what he has said.
Here it is in part only:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The railroads, in fighting the parcels post through the country merchants,
are playing the old game. The old game is to work upon the fears of a minority,
create what appears to be a difference of opinion among the people, and thus give
Congress an opportunity to say that as sentiment seems to be divided, it would
perhaps be better to do nothing until the public can thrash the matter out and
discover what it wants. In the present instance we see great firms like Marshall
Field &amp; Company combined in an organization to spread among country merchants
fear of a parcels post. Such an association was recently formed in Chicago
with a membership of 300.…</p>

<p>There is only one country merchant, perhaps, to every 500 country customers,
and the country customers are all in favor of a parcels post. All other things
being equal, Congress always moves in the direction of the greatest number of
votes. But in this matter, as in many others, things are not equal. Great
financial interests and a few country merchants are regarded by Congress as a
majority.…</p>

</div>

<p>“At any rate, I cannot forget that while Marshall Field &amp; Company
cry out against a parcels post, because it would build up the mail
order houses, that they themselves do a large mail order business.</p>

<p>“This action on their part may seem like patriotism of the highest
sort&mdash;but it isn’t. The mail order houses don’t care a rap about a
parcels post. They are not against it, but they are not for it. My
authority for this statement is Mr. Julius Rosenwald, President of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company of Chicago, the largest mail order house
in the world. I approached him upon the subject, believing that he
would grow enthusiastic, but he didn’t. He said he had never
signed a petition for a parcels post, or otherwise interested himself in
the matter, and never should do so. He didn’t tell me why, but I
found out why and will tell you.</p>

<p>“The minimum freight rates of the railroads literally drive country
customers into the mail order houses. A farmer’s wife, we will say,
has a present need for two or three articles that she can buy from a
mail order house for less than her local merchant can afford to sell
them to her. But the articles weigh only fifteen pounds, the express
charge would annihilate her saving, and the minimum freight rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
for which she might as well have 100 pounds shipped to her, is just as
high as the express rate. But she still wants the two or three articles
and she wants to buy them from the mail order house. So what does
this thrifty woman do? First, she increases her order by putting
down a few articles that she will need perhaps three months later.
Then she canvasses her neighbors for orders until she gets enough to
make 100 pounds, and divides the freight charges pro rata. The
result is that the mail order house gets an order for 100 pounds of
goods instead of an order for the fifteen pounds that would have been
bought if a parcels post like the English or the German had enabled
the farmer’s wife to order only what she first meant to buy. Incidentally,
the country merchant in her vicinity is not helped thereby.</p>

<p>“If you have any doubt about the truth of this statement, send a
petition for a parcels post to Mr. Julius Rosenwald, President of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, Chicago, and see how quickly he will
not sign it. You will not be able to get him to lift a finger to help you.
He is sending out fifty-eight loaded freight cars each day, comparatively
little express matter, doing a business of $63,000,000 a year, and
is quite satisfied with such transportation facilities as exist.</p>

<p>“But don’t blame the mail order men because they don’t help you.
Help yourself. First, help yourself by getting it clearly in your
mind who in this matter is the chief offender. Your government is
the chief offender. So far as postal matters are concerned, your
government is protecting the interests that are robbing you. Your
government goes even to the extent of submitting to robbery at the
hands of the interests that rob you. I refer to the continuing scandal
of exorbitant mail contracts.”…</p>

<p>Now, I desire to talk somewhat directly to the rural and village
storekeeper and of storekeeping.</p>

<p>The manufacturer, wholesaler or jobber always sells the retail
merchant&mdash;<i>the quantity buyer</i>&mdash;<i>cheaper</i> than they will sell in broken
lots to the consumer. They will always sell to <i>you</i> cheaper than they
will sell to your customer, will they not?</p>

<p>You have an “edge” of 20 to 40 per cent., have you not? But
to hold that “edge” now, you must order in quantities which <i>anticipate</i>
the demands of your custom, must you not? You must “stock up,”
must you not? If you miss your guess, and <i>underbuy</i> the demands of
your trade, you must, later, “sort up,” must you not? If you sort-up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
you do it at “broken-lot” rates and pay <i>excessive carriage charges</i> for
delivery to your place of business, do you not? If, on the other hand,
you <i>overbuy</i> the demands of your trade, your shelves are soon full of
“shelf-worns,” are they not? These shelf-worns you must unload,
must you not? To do that, you offer “bargains,” do you not? Unloading
“bargains” <i>loses your “edge”</i>&mdash;your <i>profits</i>&mdash;does it not?</p>

<p>But still another point in your present <i>and compelled</i> method of
business. Your customer is <i>never</i> so well pleased with your <i>sacrifice</i>
“bargains” as he or she is with the <i>fresh, up-to-date article</i>, which you
sell at a <i>profit</i>. Is that not so?</p>

<p>Now, let us see how a <i>cheap</i> parcels post would “knock your
business silly.” Let’s put the rate, say at 5 cents for parcels up to
one pound, 8 cents to two pounds, 10 cents to three pounds, 12 cents
to four pounds, and so shading up in weight to twenty-five pounds,
<i>at one cent a pound</i>. I present this scale of weights and prices merely
to illustrate. I have given them no particular thought or consideration&mdash;that
is, I do not present them as a <i>recommended</i> basis for a
parcels carriage system. I believe, however, that the government
can carry and <i>deliver</i> parcels at about the rates named <i>and not create
any larger “deficits”</i> than the postal service now shows.</p>

<p>That aside, let us see how you, Mr. <i>Retail</i> Country Merchant,
would come out in the deal:</p>

<p><i>First</i>: You would not have to “stock up” beyond the <i>known</i>
demands of your customers. Your “shelf-capital,” then, would need
not, necessarily, be more than <i>half</i> what is now is.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: You could serve your customers fresh goods of latest
pattern and at <i>less</i> cost, and still serve them <i>at a profit</i>, instead of
working off shelf-worn “bargains” on them at a <i>loss</i>.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>: Mrs. Lucy Smith sees a Sereno Payne <i>imported</i> glove,
advertised by an “eastern merchant” or some distant “mail order
house.” It is the “very latest” and guaranteed to be the very best
“kid” ever built&mdash;from a <i>premature</i> calf. Or Uncle Joe wants a
mop rag-holder for Martha. It, too, is advertised by some distant
manufacturer, merchant or mail-order bogey man. Say the advertised
price of each is $1.00. Each, of course, weighs <i>less than one
pound</i>.</p>

<p>Now, if Mrs. Smith or Uncle Joe orders <i>direct</i>, the article costs
them, postage added at our hypothetical rate, $1.05. Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
they will have inquired of you before they ordered&mdash;to see if you have
it in stock&mdash;will they not? Well, you haven’t it in stock&mdash;and you
can’t work off on them “something just as good.” Mrs. Smith just
<i>must</i> have those particular gloves, and no other mop-holder will
satisfy Uncle Joe. Now what do you do?</p>

<p>Do you tear off a yard or two of tirade about mail order houses
that are “knocking your business silly” and about manufacturers who
are “flooding the country with fake goods?” If you do, you ought to
quit business and go put your head in pickle or take the “cure.”
But you won’t tirade. No sir, nary tirade from you! You will be
onto your job in a minute. And why?</p>

<p>Well, first, you know that you can get those gloves or that
mop-holder for 20 <i>to</i> 40 <i>per cent less</i> than the rate advertised for Mrs.
Smith and Uncle Joe. You can have either sent by mail and deliver
it to Mrs. Smith or Uncle Joe at the <i>advertised</i> rate, pay the parcels
charge yourself and still make 10 to 20 cents on the deal. If the
gloves or the mop-holder strikes you as a probable “seller,” you can
order a half dozen or a dozen pairs of the gloves, or three or four
mop-holders, and <i>still keep your parcel inside the one or two pound rate</i>.</p>

<p>One other point in closing:</p>

<p>Well, it may be of no use&mdash;of <i>no</i> service value to the reader who
asks the question. He may be a man who has reached his limit
of endurance&mdash;who has given up all hope of improving or correcting
<i>legalized</i> injustices which <i>rob him to enrich others</i>. If so, he has my
sympathy. Or he may be a man who has “set into the game” and
lost, or one who is <i>hired</i> as a capper, steerer or “look out” for its
operators. I cannot say. If the former, he still has my sympathy; if
the latter, my contempt.</p>

<p>I am fully convinced that the outrages permitted by the municipal,
state and national governments of this country in rendering
public service to its people have <i>discouraged thousands</i> of its <i>best
citizens</i>&mdash;best in <i>manhood</i> I mean, of course. The beneficiaries of the
outrages I speak of are, usually, rated as “best” at the bank, in the
society columns and <i>in court proceedings</i>. Even our divorce court
records give the latter <i>conspicuous precedence</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</div>
<div class="verse">Where wealth accumulates and men decay.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No truer thought as to the politics and policy of <i>government</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
ever written than that. When wealth accumulates by <i>legalizing</i>
the spoliation and exploitation of the great body of a nation’s people
for the benefit of a few, <i>the decay of its manhood is all the more rapid</i>.
When any considerable body of a nation’s citizens begins to ask,
“What is the use?”&mdash;that nation has reached the danger line&mdash;has
started down the decline.</p>

<p>Now, I undertake to say that no observing man of average intelligence
can be found in this country today who will not give it as
his <i>honest opinion</i>&mdash;unless, of course, he is <i>hired</i> to say otherwise&mdash;that
not only thousands but <i>millions</i> of our people&mdash;of its industrial,
productive manhood and womanhood&mdash;are asking, “What is the use”
of arguing and struggling against the oppressive conditions which the
<i>laws and our administrative and judicial officers force upon us</i>? What
is the use of “knocking” the men who get the “graft,” the rake-off
or the loot?</p>

<p>“Their big bunch of money,” says one writer, “makes so much
<i>noise</i>, no one hears our knocks.” “Everybody is out for the stuff,”
says another. “It is <i>their</i> representatives not ours who make the
laws and it is <i>their</i> judges not ours who adjudicate them.” “Industry,
thrift, brains and even <i>honesty</i> have ceased to count anywhere, save
on <i>their</i> payrolls. <i>Money alone counts.</i>”</p>

<p>“Stop knocking, my son,” has become <i>common</i> in paternal
counsel. “Sit into the game and <i>get money</i>. Of course, ‘get it
honestly if you <i>can</i>, but <i>get it</i>.’”</p>

<p>“And if I fail,” asks the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, my son, unless you are careful to salt away in some place
secure from assessors and raiders as well as from thieves, the chips
<i>I have raked in</i>, your best course is to <i>get on the payroll of the
gamesters</i>.”</p>

<p>A recent reading says, in effect, that there are dropped into the
life of every man moments in which “he has the chance to act the
hypocrite or to act the scoundrel.” But when <i>aided and abetted</i> by
the law, such “chances” are not merely for the <i>moment</i>. They
extend through days and years, and those so aided and abetted usually
take <i>both</i> chances&mdash;<i>act both the hypocrite and the scoundrel, and to the
time limit of their protected opportunity</i>.</p>

<p>But that is neither all nor the <i>worst</i> of it.</p>

<p>This <i>legalized</i> hypocrisy and scoundrelism is now <i>widely</i> known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
to the honest, productive citizenship of the country, <i>and it is daily
becoming better known</i>. What is the result? Simply this:</p>

<p>The law and government administrators are, in permitting
such injustices, not only <i>creating class distinction</i> by the enrichment of
a few of our citizens and holding the millions to the subsistence level&mdash;<i>hundreds
of thousands of them to the “bread-line”</i>&mdash;not only that, but
legalized and <i>protected</i> injustice is <i>dignifying hypocrisy and
scoundrelism</i>. It is sapping the <i>moral foundations</i> of a worthy manhood
as well as <i>robbing</i> it of its material wealth and earnings.</p>

<p>But what has this sermonizing to do with the parcels post
question, some one asks? It has this to do with it!</p>

<p><i>Of the numerous array of law enriched hypocrites and
scoundrels in this country, nowhere can be found more of them to
the lineal or square rod than can be counted in the ranks of the favored
beneficiaries of existing postal laws and regulations&mdash;in the
ranks of the opponents to cheapening and bettering the parcels
carriage service.</i></p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
